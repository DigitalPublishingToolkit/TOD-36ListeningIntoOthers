Listening is a political act. It can only be enacted from a position of
power, but it is precisely on this account, that this act is also laden
with the possibilities of disrupting, challenging and dismantling the
mesh of the intersectionalities of the performative, and eventually
insidiously existing, hierarchies of power relationships. In its
enacting, the task of listening compels acknowledging and accommodating
the grammar, vocabulary and the structures of the s*elves* which
constitute the identified *other.* But more fundamentally and
significantly, the ‘act’ of listening, as a constitutive practice of the
identified o*ther,* and as a philosophical punctum, political rupture,
and poetic interruption allows the identified o*ther’s* interiority to
resound in its loudness or perform itself in its firm silences. The
o*ther* is at once denied ‘silence’ as a state of being and subjected to
‘silencing’ as manner of becoming. The identified o*ther,* across the
spectrum and landscape of power negotiations and particular
constructions, is always imagined in is hollowness.

This book fundamentally makes a call for *listening* as a methodological
praxis and political intervention to engage with the self of the others
and acknowledging the others of the identified other. In the act of
*othering,* the essays in the book identify the assertion of extending
‘meaning to oneself’. Whilst the essays, interrogate, highlight and
problematizes the strategic manners in which the identified others are
othered along the axis and intersections of social, cultural, political
and emotional, among others, disenfranchisement; in denying the
identified *others* the capacities of *othering,* the hegemonic self
unleashes (or at least attempts) the ultimate erasure of the ontological
Self of the Other. Is the ‘self’, after all, ‘*nothing other than a form
or function of referral’*?

Thus: Listening as a methodology necessitates, first and foremost, the
muting of the hegemonic self. As a political intervention, it demands
the ontological praxis for the *others* to listen into their *self,* and
that this *listening* accrues the validity and veracity of and as robust
knowledge-systems within which when the *other* speaks, it is not
reckoned to be in tongues. The denial of the *listening(s)* onto/into
themselves, the hegemonic self intends to ‘neutralize listening within
himself, so that he cannot philosophize’ having thus denied the others
most fundamental claims to the structure of the self, the hegemonic self
then extends its willing ears - insists that it is *all ears* which in
fact ‘belongs to a register of philanthropic oversensitivity, where
condescension resounds alongside good intentions; thus it often has a
pious ring to it’.

In insisting on the *listening(s)* by the others of their other, the
essays in the book attempt to engage in the politics and praxis of
*othering* as practiced by the identified Others. It is in the processes
and practices of *othering* that the self of the other is to be
recognised. In the othering, as is evidenced by the manner in which the
hegemonic self encapsulates the complexity of the others into a
singularity solely premised on the former’s reflexive and referential
*listening* of the latter, the others’ landscapes of reflexive and
referential of making meaning of the self are to be unveiled.

> When two people are conversing with one another, however, a third is
> always present: Silence is listening. This is what gives breadth to a
> conversation: when the words are not moving merely within the narrow
> space occupied by the two speaker, but comes from afar, from the place
> where silence is listening. That gives the words a new fullness. But
> not only that: the words are spoken as it were from the silence, from
> that third person, and the listener receives more than the speaker
> alone is able to give. Silence is the third speaker in such a
> conversation.[^2_2]

Thus, Max Picard identifies central and critical to the task of a
conversation, a validation of the act of speaking is silence.
Furthermore, Foucault, in drawing out his self-portrait in conversation
with Stephen Riggins, insists on ‘silence \[as\] a specific form of
experiencing a relationship with others’, which he ‘believe\[s\] is
really worthwhile cultivating’ and he is in, ‘favor of developing
silence as a cultural ethos’.[^2_3] In the same interview, Foucault
whilst recognizing certain silence for fostering ‘deep friendship,
emotional admiration, even love’ also attributes it the potential to
imply ‘very sharp hostility’. For Picard whilst silence is the third
speaker, if not punctuated with ‘speech’ - an exchange, silence is
rendered meaningless retaining its ‘wild pre-human monster’ form. It is
through the act of ‘speech’ that silence ‘is transformed into something
tame and human’.

In making a call for listening as a methodological framework, political
intervention and theoretical praxis, particularly to engage with the
identified Other, it is not without deliberation that I begin with a
rumination on silences. There is an inherent anxiety in talking about
*listening* as an embodied auditory experience and methodological
intervention motivated by definite political ambitions. And here lies
the tension: unless not compelled by considerations of *paracusis* of
varying orders *listening* as a function of a 'healthy' body is an
involuntary act. Because: the ears, they don't close. And thus when I
make a call for listening with its methodological and political
deliberations, is there not implicit an assumption of deafness in these
regards, of the closing of the ears, so to say?

Oliver Sacks in *Seeing Voices* meticulously disrupted the notion of
‘world of utter, unbroken soundlessness and silence’ which both the
deaf, suffering from the pathological, and deaf, as a cultural
symptomatic, live in.[^2_4] The silence I draw attention to, whilst insisting
on listening, is the one which in both Picard’s and Foucault’s reckoning
is pregnant with possibilities at once of ethical cohabitation - an
equitable exchange - and oppressive obliteration of the self. Silence as
social, cultural, political and emotional act is denied to the others.
The self on the other hand desires and demands *silence* as a revered
state of consciousness and a right to inculcate its finer tunings; to
nurture its solidness; to have undisrupted reflexiveness; to reverate
silence as a meditative path to higher unfurling the higher selves. But
silence as a right is denied to the other: however much the self dreads
the noise of the other, its silence is even more demonic. The noise of
the other is evidencing of its industriousness geared to serve the
purpose of the self, to constantly be in service of sustaining the
silences which the self insists on. Moreover, even in its persistent
humming, even though causing discomfort, the other is accommodated; in
doing so, it is after all but a rambling, incoherent entity incapable of
ruminations and thus also lack the agency to demand a dialogue. The only
silences permissible to the other are in its real and figurative
obliteration. The denial of silence to the other is a strategic ploy
by the hegemonic ideologies, insidiously at play, changing a note here
and there, never the entire operatic scale, to evoke the incoherence of
the other as a foundational premise to not initiate a dialogue, and in
doing so, sustaining the ‘monologue of power’.[^2_5] The listening to the
others in the essays in this book is punctuated by silences,
ruminations, ramblings and ruptures towards dialogues, not always
conciliatory and comforting, but definitely to ever-so-slightly change
the notes in the ‘monologue of power’.

## Sonic Strategies of the Self: The Political Instrumentality of Listening

> A voice means this: there is a living person, throat, chest, feelings,
> who sends into the air this voice, different from all other voices. A
> voice involves the throat, saliva, infancy, the patina of experienced
> life, the mind's intentions, the pleasure of giving a personal form to
> sound waves. What attracts you is the pleasure this voice puts into
> existing: into existing as voice; but this pleasure leads you to
> imagine how this person might be different from every other person, as
> the voice is different.

This is a quote from Italo Calvino's *A King Listens,* a story in which
the position of the king, literally and figuratively, depends on
‘listening into’, and here, ‘the palace is the ear of the king’.[^2_6]
This ability to hear into the palace, which gives the king his power,
also leaves him restricted to his throne – if he moves, even briefly,
there is a danger he will miss something significant – maybe sounds of
rebellion or deceit. He listens not only because he is ‘condemned to
listen’ as ‘we have no ear lids’, but because he has to keep his ‘ears
open’ to maintain the status quo and his power.[^2_7] Owing to the
inherent disembodied and thus un-containable - *detached from the
solidity of things* – of the *voice*, the burden of listening which the
King in this tale has to endure, forgoing even his carnal and other
sundry pleasures, almost evokes sympathy. But, beyond and besides, the
burden, the *listening* is not only integral but essential for the King
– and by that extension the State, and those in dominant, hegemonic
roles – to maintain their position. And herein lies the real tension,
and thus the anxiety: in its inherent *un-containability* the *voice*
has the potential to transgress boundaries – of spaces (physical,
political and intellectual) – lending it its obscene disruptiveness so
dreaded by those in power. I will do so by making a categorical
distinction between hearing and listening to specifically identify the
sites – the ears, so to say – where the moralising politics and
containing of the sounds are enacted.

Hearing is the encounter with the ubiquity and ephemerality of
soundscapes; while listening is the experiencing of soundscapes,
informed by one’s social, cultural and moral leanings. It is a matter of
deliberation to draw this distinction between hearing and listening. I
argue that it is between this encounter and experience that the politics
of production, performance and articulation of sounds unfolds. While
everyone translates the encounters with soundscapes into organised
experiences, I further argue that not all and everyone’s experiences –
and, thus, listening(s) – accord legitimacy to the organisation of
sounds as noise, music and silence. It is in asking questions, such as
the following, that these forms of politics can be teased out: whose
experiences of soundscapes – that is, listening – are given preference
and whose listening is not?; how and where is such listening desired and
demanded?; how does the character of space, cultural contexts and
soundscapes alter and transform with impositions of certain kinds of
listening?; and what are the ways in which non-recognised listening(s)
filters in and out of these soundscapes?

Within this framing, the city–slum relationship can be presented as one
unfolding within listener – hearer praxis. And within the everyday
materiality of the Govindpuri slums, these positionalities are also
constantly negotiated. There is a highly paternalistic, moralistic,
infantilizing tendency informing the ethnographies on and of the slums,
they rarely acknowledge the contestations and negotiations of power as
manifest in the hegemonic self (city) - muted others (slums) within the
life worlds of the slums. In doing so, these undertakings continue to
the task of contributing and consolidating the notion of the other as a
rambling, incoherent entity, thus both denying them their silences as
also the claims and agency to demand a dialogue.

From within the interiority of the Govindpuri slums, listening into its
pulse, here I narrate some of the highly fluid, dynamic, political and
contested sonic strategies of obscene, perverse performance of the self
vis-a-vis the identified other.

## The ‘Noisy’ Other

The Totas form a prominent community in Nehru camp. This community hails
from Maharashtra, and has South Indian lineage. They are fortune-tellers
who use parrots as an aide; thereby the name ‘Tota’, which literally
translates as parrots. This is their livelihood. P. Nagaraja in *South
Asian Folklore*, details the manner in which fortunes are told using
parrots by this community:

> These fortune-tellers go around the streets announcing their presence,
> or wait along footpaths or in front yards of busy buildings like
> temples or offices. Usually wearing a Maharashtrian cap, the parrot
> astrologer carries a cage of parrots and a bag of cards, a book, and a
> few remedies for misfortune, such as stones or talismans \[…\] The
> fortune teller “reads” the figure and the fortune in a peculiar
> Marathi dialect mixed with syncretic forms of other South Indian
> languages in a catchy shrill voice and emphatic pronunciation. For
> “elaboration” upon the reading he “consults” the book he carries with
> him. Usually clients are offered “remedies” for evil eye or other
> misfortune, first in the form of a prescription and later from the
> various objects in the bag.[^2_8]

The interaction of this community with others is limited in Nehru camp.
They are uncouth, loud, and immoral in the articulations of the dominant
groups. Women and children are not allowed to interact with them. I was
also advised to exercise caution when interviewing them. In the dominant
narratives, the main reason for their ostracisation was their loud
habits, coarse language, and ‘emphatic pronunciation’. These, along with
their magical powers, make them highly vulnerable to scrutiny.

Members of the Tota community, aware of these prejudices, have their own
reasons for maintaining a distance:

> We are fortune-tellers. Whether you believe it or not, we have the
> ability to predict the future. In some cases, even avert misfortunes.
> The parrots are not just props. It requires years of practice to
> master the skill. We are a very close community because we have to
> pass this knowledge from generation to generation to keep the
> tradition alive. We cannot compromise with that. We cannot share our
> secrets with those who are not part of the group. Most people think we
> do nothing but sing, dance, and drink – yes, we do – but all of this
> is part of the learning process. We also sing and dance because we
> want to. There are others in these camps who are involved in far more
> deplorable activities than us – selling drugs, prostitution, alcohol –
> but they are not targeted. It’s us. We enjoy what we do and, yes, we
> do make money. If they don’t want to talk to us neither do we.

The position of the Tota community in Nehru camp, in relation to other
dominant communities, is that of the hearer. The Totas are excluded from
social and cultural interactions. By eliminating the scope of a
dialogue, the Totas are denied a voice. The sonic practices of the
Totas, however, complicate this positioning. The dominant groups in the
Nehru camp have established a very strict sensorial code of conduct to
interact with the Totas. As hearers, any sonic production and
performance of Totas is articulated as noise by other dominant groups.

Commenting on noisy Totas, a senior member of the local administrative
body for Nehru camp said:

> It is irritating. It gives us headaches. Sometimes they continue
> playing music late into the night as well. But, what can we do except
> warn them at times? We cannot call the police that Totas are
> disturbing us \[…\] they will not listen to us anyway. For them, we
> all are one. And, how can one regulate it? There is no way you can
> say, there, that is the person who is responsible for it; you cannot
> keep targeting the entire community. If we can identify one or two
> persons we might take action. But if it’s the entire community we are
> against, who we know is not going to single out people, we cannot do
> much.

The voiceless Tota community in the existing hegemonic structure assumes
a ‘loud’ character owing to the peculiarities of sound production,
performance and articulation. It is quite a common practice in the
Govindpuri slums for communities to play loud music, however, not all
music is categorised as noise, nor all its producers regarded as
uncouth.

In conversation with the members of the Tota community, I raised the
issue of the ‘loud’ music:

> We are surely not the only ones who play loud music. We are a very
> close community. Unlike other communities in the camp we do not tell
> on each other, fight with each other \[...\] we are like a big family.
> We like to do everything together and that includes singing and
> dancing. Also, some of the music we play is important for our children
> to learn the trade.

For the members of the Tota community, playing loud music is not only an
act of deliberate resistance, it is a community-building exercise. Loud
music as *noise* consolidates the position of the Tota community on two
accounts: first, the collective production and consumption of music
represent a strategy to reiterate the sense of solidarity amongst the
community; and second, it allows them to extend their territoriality
beyond the social, cultural and moral landscape where their interactions
are limited. While the loud music as *noise* gives the Tota community a
sense of solidarity, confidence and security, it challenges the
authority of the dominant group by compelling them to *hear* the
presence of the Totas, even if the dominant group wants to ignore them.

The collectivity of soundscapes from the slums, including those of the
Totas, is articulated as noise by the middle classes. The dominant
groups in both instances – communities who ostracise the Totas within
the Govindpuri slums and the middle classes who ostracise the entire
slum settlement – refuse to *listen into* their soundscapes and afford
them acceptable sonic meanings. While the sonic production and
performance of disempowered groups – in this case, *Totas* and
slum-dwellers – allow them to have a distinct sonic presence, its
articulation as noise by dominant groups only aggravates the processes
of othering through which they are further discriminated against,
segregated and excluded.

## Silencing, Silence and Unlistening

Meena is Diya’s sister-in-law. Since 2004, Diya has been living in her
paternal home, along with her son, following an altercation with her
husband’s family. This eventually led to a breakdown of communication
between the two families and any chance of reconciliation between Diya
and her husband are slim. Her parents initially supported Diya and
acknowledged the mental and physical torture she had to endure in her
marital home. However, with the passing of years, her presence is seen
as a financial burden and a matter of social shame for the family. This
leads to frequent altercations between her, her brothers and parents.
Meena is married to Diya’s eldest brother, who constantly abuses Meena,
emotionally and physically. Even though both Meena and Diya are
sympathetic and supportive of each other’s predicament, they can do
little for each other. Neither of them gets any support from the family.
Both employ different sonic strategies to negotiate their disempowered
position. They both are hearers.

Diya has, over the last few years, assumed a ‘loud’ temperament. She
openly criticises her parents, laments their failure to initiate
reconciliatory dialogue with her husband, and bemoans the limited
resources made available to her. This sonic performance usually happens
in the street. In her house, she is denied such permissions. When I
first tried establishing an acquaintance with her, I was constantly
informed that she was ‘mad’. Every time I would approach her to initiate
a conversation, her neighbours – mostly women – would join the
conversation, uninvited. They would talk over Diya’s conversation and
offer testimonies of her life, totally ignoring her presence. She is
consistently silenced. Her sonic productions and performances were
denied any validity, and thereby an acceptable articulation, because of
her projected madness. Even though she was heard, she was not listened
into. Her loud behaviour, which openly challenged the dominant familial
roles, was articulated as a sign of definite madness. She has no history
of clinical insanity.

Meena, on the other hand, assumed a different sonic strategy to
negotiate her position. In the initial years, she tried to engage her
in-laws and her neighbours to address her abuse. Her ‘loudness’, she
mentioned, would only lead to more abuse. Eventually, she stopped having
any sonic interactions with others. By maintaining a silent sonic
presence, she not only refuses to acknowledge and engage with the sonic
hierarchies established by her family, she does not allow them any scope
to either validate or negate her sonic performances. She listens to
herself, she said, and finds peace in it as she knows no one else knows
what she is listening into. Indeed, her family is much intrigued by her
silence, often articulating it as an act of defiance; however, the
instances of abuse against her have decreased as her silent demeanour is
considered ‘threatening’, according to her mother-in-law.

Slum-dwellers who have sustained engagement with the middle classes, as
domestic servants, drivers, guards and gardeners, have to follow a
highly prescriptive code of conduct in the extended sensorial realm.
Sonically, they are *silenced* and expected to perform *silence*. This
is most exaggerated in the case of drivers, who share intimate space
with their employers and often overhear their conversations,
interactions and engagements. Men from the Govindpuri slums who work as
drivers in middle-class households have a sonically dominant position in
their immediate sonic realm, yet they are disempowered in their extended
sonic realm by their inability to either engage or define sonic
practices. Moreover, in this realm they have to take orders from
middle-class women, which further challenge their position. In this
extended sonic realm, men have to sonically perform *unlistening,* which
in their immediate sonic realm women – as hearers – tend to rely on as a
sonic strategy.

The soundscape of the Govindpuri slums abounds in its multiplicity. In
their sonic interactions with men, specifically, women as hearers do not
have the legitimacy to engage or influence sonic practices. Men,
enjoying the liberties they have, use abusive language, and discuss
sensitive matters of financial, social and moral importance openly and
loudly. They rely on *unlistening* as a strategy to negotiate this
predicament.

A young woman who moved into the settlement with her husband, after her
marriage found the use of abusive language increasingly disconcerting.
In her immediate sonic realm, she was not used to men openly expressing
abuse in front of women and found it very offensive. When she confronted
her husband, he severely reprimanded her for *listening into* his
private conversation. She has been in the settlement for the last eight
years now, and she can both perform and pretend to perform *unlistening*
as the situation demands:

> There are times when you just stop listening, you zone out but at
> other times it is convenient to pretend that you are not listening,
> especially when financial matters are discussed. This way I can at
> least keep some tabs on him.

*Unlistening* as a sonic performance is employed by different
disempowered groups across the Govindpuri slums to maintain sonic
balance, which men working in middle-class households have to assume as
well. Even though disempowered groups – women in the immediate sonic
realm and men in their extended sonic realm – perform *unlistening* and
*silence* and are *silenced,* they attempt to subvert these social
hierarchies by relying on gossiping and eavesdropping as sonic
strategies.

## Gossiping

*Gossiping* is not harmless, social bantering. It is an effective sonic
strategy subvert dominant social and cultural positions. Aruna is a
25-year-old petite, confident woman. I first met her not in Navjeevan
camp, where she resides, but in the office of a nearby organisation that
provides free legal counselling to Govindpuri residents in Bhumhiheen
camp. She was seeking advice regarding her divorce and child custody.
During the period of my research, I volunteered in this organisation
once a week to help the counsellor with filing and other administrative
needs. As we discussed her case, it became evident that the separation
was acrimonious and on more than one occasion her husband had been
physically abusive. Mrs Dave, the counsellor, advised her to take
immediate action – a report was filed in the nearby police station and
the women’s cell. Over the next few weeks, her husband – who did not
live in the Govindpuri slums – was restrained from visiting Aruna and
their daughter in Navjeevan camp. The husband was incensed by this
decision. Soon afterwards, unknown to Aruna or her family, he started
making visits to the prominent tap areas along Aruna’s water route;
everyone knew him as Aruna’s husband. While spending time at the tap
areas, he started telling ‘stories’ about Aruna, including but not
limited to her involvement in prostitution rackets and the ways to
solicit her. The multiple conflating soundscapes in the tap areas were
exploded by the sonic sensation this information generated. The events
to follow took a very unfortunate turn. Aruna was persistently harassed
by rowdy men, who propositioned her when she moved around the camps,
making even the most basic of movements unsafe for her. Eventually,
Aruna’s family took serious action and her ex-husband was put behind
bars for three months. This did not mean that ‘stories’ about Aruna
stopped circulating in and around her neighbourhood; however, people
started questioning their validity since her husband, the main
perpetrator, had been jailed. For most, this was a definite sign that he
was lying. Aruna was not very optimistic about this turn of events. She
expressed her distress about having to shift from the Govindpuri slums
in the near future. When I inquired about the reason for the move,
considering that her family lived in the slums and she had a strong
support network, she said it was on account of her daughter:

> Right now, she is young, she doesn’t understand. There are people who
> will come outright and say my husband was wrong, he was spreading
> rumours, etc. but that doesn’t stop the rumours and gossip. People
> will keep talking even years later. I don’t want my daughter to grow
> up listening to stories about how I was abandoned by my husband for
> being a prostitute. I find peace in the fact that he is in the prison
> but he will be released soon; I, on the other hand, am caught for life
> in this story he has created.

After their separation, Aruna’s husband was well aware that he would not
be welcome in Aruna’s family home, nor those of neighbours or relatives.
However, he managed to tap into the volatile water route and networks,
through which he knew he could harm the reputation of Aruna and her
family, as it is one of the most important means to transmit
information, gossip and news in the locality. He was aware that here,
people – even those who did not approve of him – would listen to his
stories.

Within the soundscapes of the Govindpuri, gossip allows women as hearers
to assert their sonic selves, otherwise denied to them, as most of these
networks are controlled by older women. While the younger women in the
Govindpuri slums are under constant scrutiny and are required to
maintain a strict sensorial decorum, age allows the older women
permission to forgo these restrictions. In certain instances, they tend
to assume a very ‘masculine’ decorum. Bodily noises, which the younger
women have to find ingenious ways to mask, are nonchalantly performed in
public by older women. They abuse as obscenely and as loudly – if not
more so – than the men. During the day, in the absence of the men, these
older women, matriarchs, control the sonic networks. There is usually
one matriarch in a community who exercises absolute control. She has an
extensive network of *listeners* who inform and update her about the
sonic performances of others. These are then articulated – either
validated or denied – within the gossip networks.

In one instance, a family settled in Navjeevan camp permitted their
daughter ‘unprecedented’ freedoms, including college education and
mobile phones. These freedoms implied ‘mobilities’ denied to others. The
matriarch did not approve of the freedoms given to this girl, believing
it would only encourage other girls also to waver from the path and
assume loud, uncouth practices’. This young girl was under constant
sonic scrutiny. Not so surprisingly, the girl was apparently *heard*
having romantic conversations over the phone. A communal meeting was
called for, the girl and her parents were summoned, her phone records
were validated, and it was established that the girl was having an
‘affair’. The parents were strictly reprimanded for this digression and
threatened ostracisation if they did not impose restrictions on their
daughter. She had to give up her education and, obviously, no longer had
access to the mobile phone.

The slum-dwellers, men and women, working in middle class households
also use *gossiping* as an effective sonic strategy to subvert and
challenge their disempowered position in the extended sonic realm. Even
though these gossip tactics do not have the same impact as gossip within
the slums, on many occasions they have managed to create tensions and
rifts amongst middle class families by transferring information from one
network to another. The middle class, well aware of these gossiping
tactics, try to maintain the sonic distance by conversing in English, a
language most slum-dwellers do not understand, in the presence of their
domestic servants. These sonic strategies of the self from the
interiority of the slums exhibit a strong ‘sonically ordered sense of
self’ of the slum dwellers.[^2_9] Second, it highlights the definite sonic
strategies employed by dominant and disempowered groups (both within the
slums and slum dwellers collectively *vis-à-vis* the middle classes) to
reiterate and circumvent social, cultural and political hierarchies.

## The Sounds of Slumming (Or, Matters of Sonically Slumming)

By *reading* the city as text, where ‘ordinary men’ are scribes,
*walkers*, ‘whose bodies follow the thicks and thins of an urban ‘text’
they write without being able to read it’, Michel de Certeau privileges
sight as the sensual anchor to experience as well as produce space and
its dynamics.[^2_10] Indeed, de Certeau’s city is Western, visual and
masculine; however, in his readings he resolutely acknowledges the
agency vested in the common people – the silent majority – to displace
the rationality of urban space, ‘brutally lit by alien reason’. The
hierarchical and semantically ordered ‘surface of the city’ transforms
into ‘liberated spaces that can be occupied’ by these movements. Beyond
its cartographic moment, space transforms into an experience that is not
singularly visual in its orientation. It is populated by the calls,
murmurings, voices, tastes, smells and touches; in short, it is a
sensual experience in which each sense – hearing, smelling, touching,
seeing, tasting – defines, broadens or limits the scope of how the space
is practised, consumed, articulated, experienced and represented. Space
transforms into a ‘social experience’ through the ‘mingling of the
modalities of mingling’ of the five senses.[^2_11]

In the Indian context, specifically in the case of the Govindpuri slums,
it is difficult to articulate space as compartmentalised pockets, each
maintaining their own homogeneity. According to the 2001 census, the
population of all the three camps together was recorded as 370,665,
spread over an area of 41.85 acres. In terms of distribution of space,
this means 900 people per acre. The density of the space does not
allow for segregated spatial entities. Porosity of the city, which
Benjamin and Lacis evoked for Naples, defines the essence of everyday
reality in the Govindpuri slums.[^2_12] The walls are literally built in
each other and the roofs share an incestuous relation with the others of
their kind. The architecture has a perplexing unpredictability to it.
One never knows when one room will open into another courtyard or
kitchen. Everyday, personal lives are constantly performed in the public
eye. However, this is not to imply that there is no sense of privacy,
and no claims or authority over space. The manner in which these are
exercised has distinctly evolved within the materiality of the site. The
associations with space are not within the strict conceptual framework
of propertied claims, but are constantly negotiated within the existing
socio-cultural fabric. In the popular narratives, a displaced sense of
claims to property and its ownership emerge. The ownership is not
established in the present, temporally and geographically, but projected
in a distant future where the demolition of the existing slum settlement
will entitle slum-dwellers to land in a legal resettlement colony.

The exploration of sonic practices of space in the Govindpuri slums
furthers the embodied, temporal and interconnected understanding of how
space is created, consumed and projected. This embodied experience
provides a framework to articulate everyday life in the slums (as well
as city–slum relations) outside the hegemonic, illegal–legal binary. The
everyday reality of slums, ‘animated through sound’, reveals a complex
interplay and overlap of identity and space which significantly
determines the mobilities and positions within the
immediate–extended–imagined realm.[^2_13]

It is within these theoretical frameworks of understanding space that
the slums, in the given context, can be understood as a representative
not of the ‘marginalised’ spaces in the city, but rather the *process*
of marginalisation of spaces in the city. The lived realities and
association of the slum-dwellers cannot be understood simply within the
prism of ‘mobility’ and ‘movement’ across ‘one-directed abstraction of
time and space’. The cities inhabited, created and consumed by
slum-dwellers have to be understood as ‘a site where multiple
spatialities and temporalities collide’, and where ‘the city contains
living and moving bodies, but they are not bodies moving through
space-time, they are performing it and making it’.

The city and the slums constantly evaluate (and pre-empt) trajectories
of interaction with each other through similar cultural constructions
and categories. From the narratives in the Govindpuri slums, it emerges
that the slums’ residents view the city in the same manner as the city
represents them: as a space of moral bankruptcy. The residents who
venture into the city are advised to exercise caution. If the slums are
the other for the city, the city is also the other for the slums.
However, as the city dominates and determines the tropes through which
city–slum relations are evaluated, slums are denied a sense of self, and
the practices by which they exercise a deliberate distance – social,
cultural and spatial – from the city are denied vocabularies, and hence
an agency. Space in the Govindpuri slums is not only sonically consumed,
but sonically constructed and represented as well. The sonic interaction
amongst communities is determined by the relative positioning of the
self in the immediate–extended–imagined sensorial realms *vis-à-vis* the
other. Sonic articulations are significant in determining social,
cultural, sensual and spatial engagements with a space. The sonic
practices of space highlight these negotiations.

Drawing from these insights, instead of stating a broad hypothesis or a
set of main questions, I introduce this essay as a narrative woven
around the thematic of o*ther and othering* of the spaces of slums in
the discourse of the city and the articulation of sound/soundscapes as
an urban experience. In evoking the thematic of ‘other and othering’,
there is an inherent danger that this body of work might be approached
as consolidating the position of ‘slums’ and ‘sonic experiences’ as an
oppositional ‘other’ category vis-à-vis the mainstream, the city, and
the visual (an integral referential point to explore the urbane/city).
However, it is precisely this oppositional consolidation of these
categories, slums and sound, in the everyday experience, mainstream
media, and academic discourse that this body of work aims to rework and
challenge by exploring the process of ‘othering’ bringing to the
forefront the nuances and the lacunae of the same. The intersection of
slum and sound studies, both bodies of work which at different occasions
find position in urban history, historical accounts, social discourse,
media and cultural studies, and the field of sensory perceptions, was by
no means an easy one to navigate whilst conducting the study or framing
it within a theoretical discussion.

With all their distinctions, slums and sound studies, share the
predicament of being on the fringes, so to say, of academic-mainstream
discourse as well as experiential articulation. The situation gets
further complicated within the Indian, third world and Global South
scenario, where the narrativization of and on slums is being reworked in
languages suiting to the needs of new middle class sensibilities as well
as the burgeoning impetus to sanitize the metropolitan cities to make
them amenable for the global-western experience. In regards to sound,
the discussion is picking up momentum, albeit only within the framework
to implement more effective noise pollution regulation in tune of
sanitizing the city, particularly aimed at ‘silencing’ the identified
noisy and noises.

In that sense, bodies of work on slums and sound in the Indian context
are shrouded in an ominous silence, which pushes them further into the
domain of the ‘other’, both academically and experientially. It was this
shared predicament of these two bodies of work which allowed for this
present work to formulate a theoretical discussion around them within
the thematic of ‘other and othering’.  In the Indian context, there is
an intellectual gap in the manner in which slums are approached and
perceived. The academic tradition leans towards highlighting the lacks
at administrative, infrastructural level whilst the everyday middle
class narrative is shrouded in the language of moral, social, and
cultural decay. In the recent years, there has been some research
undertaken which attempts to move beyond these positions but these take
into account the national and state level developments, economically,
socially, politically and culturally, to enumerate the perception and
position of slums within the same. The discourses within the field of
social activism calling for better conditions and rights for slums
dwellers in the city strongly resonates with the rhetoric of
displacement and lacks, which inadvertently further calcifies the
position of the slums and its residents as the ‘other’. None of the
works, within the field of study, understand to examine the instance of
slum settlement in its own right, materiality and politics, and the
experience of the space of slum outside this dichotomous position
vis-à-vis the state or the city. It is in this regard that this body of
work intends to make a departure. At the core of my work lies an attempt
to produce an ethnography of lived, everyday, aspirational interactions,
insidious and obvious, within the *jhuggis,* and between the city and
the slums, in order to locate the slums and their materiality within a
larger discursive and experiential scope than it is usually attributed
to. Soundscapes and the politics of production, circulation, and
articulation of the same, are evoked as the reference point to
understand and explore these dynamics. J*huggis* are not anathema to the
city, whether one speaks of the city’s history or its present or future.
In fact, the dominant reckoning, interventions and reflections on the
slums contributes towards obliterating the memory of the slums in the
present but also denying them any historicity. The *jhuggis* are civic
and social spaces that are a by-product of the violent, inequitable and
exploitative processes of urbanisation. Through my essays the intent
then is to act in whatever limited way to encourage the ethics of
cohabitation across spaces, communities and ideas between spaces as the
slums and its middle-class neighbours. And lastly, to provide a response
to the everyday othering of the slum-dwellers by ‘listening to, and
recording, the details of the story the other might tell, letting that
story become part of an undeniable archive, the enduring trace of loss
that compels the ongoing obligations to mourn’.[^2_14]

## Concluding Remarks

By asking the question, ‘Can the subaltern speak?’ and answering it in
the negative, Spivak lend to the recognition of ‘voice’ as a potent
political agency for the marginalised.[^2_15] Since then the attempts to
extend this ‘voice’ has had overlapping and intersecting implications,
variously articulated both in popular and political reckoning in regards
to its significance in the rights/identity/space the subaltern can
assert and claim. In interventionist initiatives – especially, political
and developmental – this inability of the subaltern to ‘speak’ is often
translated literally. And thus the sustained efforts to extend a space
(real, virtual, mediated by technologies) to the marginalised to ‘speak’
out and thus have a voice.

However: most of these readings, and the subsequent interventions, in
fact misread Spivak's evocations, and not surprisingly leapfrog – or
completely miss out – on an a stage/situation/modality integral in
translating (validating) the act of speaking into voice as a matter of
political agency. And that is the consideration of listening. So: we
have the matter of the act of speaking translating into affective
*voice* with listening as a practice providing the necessary punctum -
the turntable, so to say, which when tuned well emanates sounds filled
with robustness and *solidity*. And whilst there is a demand, urgent and
immediate, to tune into these frequencies of theoretical considerations
for definite political actions, there is an equally compelling, perhaps
even more so in its practice, task to open our ears, systematically and
systemically, to recognise the multiplicity of the acts of speaking.

I argue that the denial of the acts of speaking to the other is
deliberated within the logics of sustaining economic, social and
political alienation such that the other always remains an
‘unactualized’ self: rambling, incoherent and in need of disciplining.
The fate of the other, who only speaks in tongues, is thus relegated to
either being silent or silenced. Critical and central to this othering
project is the denial of emotionality to the other firmly situated in
the practices of unacknowledging the acts of speaking of the other, and
rendering all the utterances of the other as cacophony. I identify the
emotional self as the availability of grammar and vocabularies to nurse,
cherish, indulge the self, to indeed have reflexive spaces and
interlocuting acts of of speaking to call out the pain, anguish, the
crushing of the soul, the injustice, violence, marginalization within
the broader matrices of class, caste, communal, spatial, gendered
negotiations. But also for the self to have the emotional capacities to
announce themselves in their full bloom. The other is strategically
denied any structures to inhabit and claim their emotionality, and in
doing so, they are then denied any structures of defiance. Sans
emotions, and emotional capacities - a self which suffers, but also
loves, cries in joy, dances in abandon, gives in to desires, makes
flippant choices, endures heartbreaks and has poetic inflections - the
other is a two-dimensional, cardboard equivalent of merely a receptacle
with no depth to evoke reaction and respond.

Deliberating on a distinction between hearing and listening in this
essay has been to highlight the manner in which encounters with spaces,
cultures and bodies translate into experiences informed by sensorial,
social, cultural and moral backgrounds. I argue that it is within, and
without, the field of force between the encounter and its translation
into an experience that politics of space, identity and gender manifest
themselves and abound in multiplicities in everyday materialities of
transforming urbanities, especially in the global South. I have also
argued that this deliberation does not limit itself to experiencing
sounds, but stretches to the body in space and the space of the body.
The body of the slum dweller in the city is considered to inhabit
illegal space thriving with informal practices. This accords her
position in the urban discourse, and her right to the city, an anxiety,
on account of either being lamented as a crisis or celebrated as ‘heroic
entrepreneurship’.[^2_16] What adds to this anxiety is the agenda of the
state to implement its projects and policies, through which these spaces
will ‘eventually be integrated into a modern and manageable economy’ ,
which, in turn, can be a blow to the informality in this economic
situation. Informality as an idea, practice and population set has been
instituted as anathematic to the projected aspiration of a ‘world-class
city’ in the global South.[^2_17] The tensions in the transforming urban
materiality of Delhi – a city with ambitions and aspirations to become a
world-class city – to accommodate these informalities is further
exaggerated by the role these spaces, specifically on account of being
informal and illegal, play in wider transformations. They extend the
cheap, readily available menial labour necessary to ensure and erect a
world-class, international city.

The sensorial and moral regimes of othering, as executed by the
deliberate un-listening and silencing, are attempts at fixing the
position of slum dwellers as the other – socially, legally, sensorially
and morally. This framing allows the state the rhetorical legitimacy to
oust them from a formal city structure when deemed appropriate, as also
to institute regimes of disciplining their bodies, individually and
collectively. Further, within this framing, the predicament of these
spaces and their residents as slums that are informal and, thus,
‘un-modern and un-manageable’, is increasingly being framed as a moral
limitation of the spaces and the residents themselves. However the
potential of the un-containability of sounds – and thus the potency of
voice as a political agency – is not completely lost to the residents of
the slums, marginalised spaces as the following essays evidence. In
these, the subaltern loves, wails, waits, argues, and shrieks; the
subaltern indeed does speak, but denied a listening – the validations of
its acts of speaking – is caught in the cul-de-sac of sublaternity in
perpetuity.
