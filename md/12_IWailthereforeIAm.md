# 6. I Wail, Therefore I Am

## The Wall

On 31 March 2008, 1,000 slum dwellings were razed to ground in the GP
slums in Kalkaji extension in South Delhi:

> Construction of a five-foot wall to divide a slum cluster from
> neighbouring middle-class colonies is wreaking havoc in south Delhi’s
> Kalkaji Extension \[...\] bulldozers razed down more than 1,000 small
> shops and homes to make way for a wall that will encircle all three
> camps in the slum cluster: Bhumiheen, Nehru and Navjeevan. Four
> hundred metres of the proposed 2-km wall are already in place, under
> construction by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) since December.
> “We are acting on an order from the High Court”, says DDA’s executive
> engineer K K Khanna. And the High Court was responding to a petition
> filed by Arsh Avtaar Singh, former president of Kohinoor Apartments
> Resident Welfare Association, in May 2005. The petition sought a
> solution against encroachment of roads and services by slum residents.
>
> Neighbouring middle-class colonies support Singh’s efforts. A

> named, says: “All my life savings have been used to purchase this
> flat. For 22 years I have lived with the stink from open defecation,
> and constant over-crowding from blocked roads”.
>
> Residents want slum dwellers to be relocated in pukka housing. “I feel
> bad for them”, says Singh, whose own domestic help lives in Bhumiheen
> Camp. “They should be given an alternative home immediately”.
>
> But the DDA claims it needs time to relocate the slum dwellers. “The
> wall is a temporary arrangement to offer protection to flat owners”,
> Khanna says. In the interim, Daliwal, a resident of Konark apartment,
> thinks the wall should be built higher. “It should be at least eight

> 50 a day, through which I cook for my family. We have nothing to eat
> today without my shop”. Trying to salvage broken chairs and cutlery
> from his former confectionery store, Izhar Ali asks, “What should I do
> to earn? Can the government give me an alternative?”\[...\] DDA’s
> Khanna, meanwhile, insists there will be several entry and exit points
> in the wall. “There are more than 17 gaps in the 400-metre stretch
> built so far”, he says.

> DDA has a May 21 deadline for building the wall.[^6_1]

A notice of planned demolition was circulated amongst the residents of
GP camps through pamphlets and announcements in the last week of March
2008. The scheduled date for the demolition was 3rd April. When the
announcements were made, resident groups, political organizations, and
NGO’s convened to contemplate a course of action to impede the
demolitions. One of the resident groups in collaboration with a leading
NGO in the area filed a petition to demand a stay order for the proposed
demolitions. The hearing of this petition was scheduled for 2nd April.

On the evening of 30th March, the residents of GP slums began noticing
surmounting police presence in the area. When inquired about their
presence, the police personnel informed the residents of the demolition
scheduled for the next day. Early in the morning on 1st April, an area
of three kilometers around GP was cordoned off by police forces
including anti-riot squads. For the next few hours, the demolition squad
systematically razed the defined slums and shops to the ground.

However, unlike other demolitions, the primary agenda of demolitions
carried in GP slums was not to evict illegal squatters. As the local
press presents it, through this act of enclosure, the authorities
consider that they will be able to curtail the movements of the slum
residents on the roads, parks, and other spaces shared by the slums and
nearby middle class residents, providing respite to the latter.

The wall is justified by the state authority on the grounds that it will
protect the ‘flat owners’ (the middle-class population) in the area. By
implication suggesting that slum-dwellers pose a threat to this section
of society. The slums have co-existed with the middle-class settlements
in this area for over twenty years. There are no recorded incidents of
violent outbursts and attacks perpetrated by the slum-dwellers towards
the middle-class population, according to a search of police records and
media reports. Instead, the middle-class homes offer employment
opportunities to slum dwellers as domestic helps, cooks, guards, and
drivers.

Following the demolition and prior to the erection of the wall, I
conducted interviews with both slum-dwellers and residents of nearby
middle class settlements to understand the perception of ‘threat’ in the
everyday context.A significant proportion of the slum’s population work
in this way, and in discussions it became clear that they would be
unlikely to jeopardize their livelihoods by violence or any other form
of direct conflict with their employers and vice-versa. The latter
simply want to assert their claims and rights to not endure the assault
- smell, noise, dirt, filth - which the presence of the *jhuggis*
unleashes on them.

The demolitions at GP, the authorities later claimed, were peaceful. In
the present, the outlines of the wall are barely visible as it has been
innovatively woven into the architectural structures of the jhuggis. The
matter of whether the wall could or could not contain the slum-dwellers
for the safety of the middle-class neighbours of the apartments is not
of consequence, what matters is that the middle-class neighbour’s
claims, owing to their position on the social-cultural-political matrix,
of desiring sanitized spaces were acknowledged and legitimized by the
courts and other state authorities.

## The ‘Noisy’ Other

From where they are, what they hear of GP slums (hereafter, ‘GP’) is
only noise. In this reckoning, sounds in GP have no intent or
imagination; they emerge out of nowhere, conflate and contradict with
other sounds sharing the same predicament, to disappear into another
nowhere-ness. To these outside ears, the noisiness of GP has only the
singular and absolute purpose to invade and disrupt their deserved
silences.

That the heard noisiness of GP from the outside—namely, the middle-class
residents—is not a matter of decibel levels, but is a ‘particular trope
of experiencing sounds is significant in defining a ‘sense of the self,’
which is effectively employed to create social, moral, and political
exclusion[^6_2]’. In the liberties with listenings I evoke here, the
politics of production, performance, and articulation of ‘noise’ as a
specific instance of sonic engagement to highlight the broader processes
of othering in the city as a sonic premise to further complicate the
reckoning of noise—politically and philosophically—in itself. In that,
the listening attempt here aims to rehabilitate noise within the sonic
triad of ‘noise-sound- silence’, wherein sonicity linearly moves from a
state of chaos, through certain validations to an absolute state of
calm. I will tease out these negotiations by attempting the biography of
a sound—wailing—in the immediate context of GP, and then extrapolate it
onto the broader materiality of the sonic capacities available to others
in the city.

Slums are marginalized spaces in the materiality of a city. And in a
city like Delhi, with its hyperbolic transformative agendas to become a
‘world-class, clean and green city’, these spaces, more than ever,
represent the perversity of a past desired to be conveniently lost:
poverty, violence, unstructured growth, over-population, dirt, filth,
and noise[^6_3]. Acutely aware of the particular and predicament of the
sustained, strategic and everyday violence of the marginalization the
slums, and its residents, encounter, the space, its sociality, and
cultural politics have their own modalities to internalize this
violence; and in that process deliberately define the boundaries of
their own margins and locate their own others. One section of society in
GP on which this violence of othering and marginalization is inscribed
is its women. Gender, however, is not the sole category of othering, and
its associative social, cultural, and political disenfranchisement. The
considerations of caste, class, communal affiliation, and political
loyalties are equally determinant in these processes, however for the
sake of the listenings proposed here, it will be the voices — or lack
thereof — of the women in GP that will form the focus of our attention.

The soundscapes in the neighbourhood of Govinpuri, including the slums,
are dense and intense. It is indeed thick. To be heard here—literally,
metaphorically, and politically—necessitates employment of effective
sonic, technological, and social interventions. Given the space of GP is
highly gendered, the women are denied these techniques of being heard,
and thus their entry and assertion into its soundscapes often remain, at
best, muted. To then extend masculinity to GP’s soundscape as an over-
arching characteristic is not an attempt at simplification of its
listenings, but an invitation to hear into it from a gender-specific
trope. One sound—more accurately an instance of sonic performance by
women in GP—however, has the potential to disrupt the intersecting
sonic, spatial, and gendered masculine hierarchies, however temporarily:
it is that of a wailing woman.

An emaciated, sickly woman is sought, and quickly found. It is an early,
cold, January morning in 2012. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi
elections are a few weeks away. I am accompanying, listening to, and
interviewing a group of women mobilized from the three camps in support
of a local candidate contesting the elections. On the said day, there is
a scheduled rally in support of the candidate. The atmosphere in the
room where the women congregate is tense, only easing when the
required—emaciated, sickly—woman is identified. Preparations are in
order—often hasty, tense, and leading to heated exchanges. I am told
these are for the rally due in a few hours, but the specifics of the
plan are not discussed and there is no room for interrogation of that
sort. The emaciated, sickly woman is the hero of the moment;
deliberations about her attire, where to get the desired at such a short
notice, and assuring, and hushed consultations with her are taking place
in a corner. I continue to listen. Eventually we set out.

The stage for this setting is an intersection leading from the camps to
the main road. The intent by now is obvious; the group of women intends
to block this intersection so that the visit of the opposing candidate
into the camps can be stalled. The execution of the intent— the plan,
now in motion—is not without its ingenuity and strategic planning. The
emaciated, sickly woman, dressed in white, is laid down in the middle of
the road on a bamboo plaque usually reserved to carry the dead to the
cremation ground. She is covered with a white sheet with her face
partially covered. It is evident by now that the role assigned to the
emaciated, sickly woman in this planning is to play dead. And she does
it quite convincingly. The women congregate around her in semi-circle,
completely blocking the intersection. The imminent arrival of the
opposing candidate is anticipated, and the women surrounding the un-dead
dead woman start wailing in a collective, synchronized and sincere
manner. It is not a cry, it is not a shriek, it is simply a ‘prolonged
high-pitched cry of pain, grief, or anger’; it is indeed an inarticulate
‘high-pitched sound’. And, this sonic intervention has its desired
effect. The candidate from the opposing party, and his cohorts, try to
circumvent this sonic blockade, so to speak: they try to initiate a
conversation with the group of wailing women; they try to placate them;
they extend promises of justice delivered—without really knowing what
the act of criminality or the grievance is being mourned over. The
women, however, refuse to relent, and continue with the wailing. The
threat of seeking police intervention to remove this sonic blockade was
unimaginable: an assault on a group of wailing women, apparently
mourning the death of one of them, would have ruined any moral
respectability for the concerned candidate in the community.

Eventually, the opposing candidate leaves without holding the scheduled
rally, and the women disperse as effectively as they had claimed the
space, sonically. The undead finally awakens, walks alongside the others
to the murmurs of applause and admiration, though not without a hint of
envy. She—the emaciated, sickly woman—is after all the silent punctum of
the incisive and effective sonic intervention: wailing.

If sound in its singular manifestation is to be reckoned as a particular
and peculiar intersection of its spatiality and temporality in the site
of its origin, then soundscapes are the simultaneity of these
intersections. A spatial-temporal matrix can contain more than one
sound, thus complicating not only the Cartesian notionalities of space
and time, but also of the sonicities it contains. Thus, a sound is not
just a moment of insular and individuated instance of utterance, but
derives its momentum from the collusions with the multiplicities that
abound these matrices: spatial, temporal, sonic, social, cultural, and
political. A listener, not unlike a cartographer, traverses through
these matrices to ‘make sense’, to hear, to map not by accompanying each
sound (or in the case of a cartographer, venturing into every crevice)
but by deliberately, unintentionally, and inadvertently leaving most
un-listened into. And thus the ears, as appendages which can never be
‘closed’, become the libraries where these listening intos are
archived.[^6_4]

But unlike a library, and an archive, with its robust physicality and
Deweyian, almost clinical sensibilities, an ‘ear’ remains a highly
individuated, and thus an ambiguous site of production of knowledge.
Lending anxiety to this ambiguity and identification of ‘listening(s)’
as a knowledge base is not only the technical matter of ears that cannot
be closed, but also sounds that cannot be contained. And thus the
individuated hearings are not so much a matter of the ears as itself,
but a more insidious and astute question of ‘but whose ears?’. The
strategic, systematic, and deliberate privileging of hearings of, and
by, certain ears— with political, social, cultural, and moral
currencies—then assumes the role of listeners selectively identifying
sounds to situate it within the sonic triad of ‘noise-sound-silence’.
These listening(s) of course do not (and cannot) contain sounds
permeating into ears and spaces; instead, they weave sounds together
into logic of those that are contaminated, the ones that are sanctioned
and others that are sanctified thus deliberating, and setting limits, to
the permissible spatial-temporal-sonic intersections in a space, moment,
and its memory. The ears that dare to hear otherwise, and the spaces
where sounds, which disrupt the precariously listened-into
spatial-temporal sonicity, abound are either silenced, deliberately un-
listened into or identified as sites of sonic contamination.

It is within this schematic that the outside listening into of GP is
collapsed into a cacophony of contaminated sounds collectively
identified as noise. This reckoning has implication both in the real and
rarefied imagination of the slums and its residents—the ears and the
space: they exist in a perpetual state of chaos, lacking potential and
imagination to move towards a validated, and eventually, a state of
calm; the chaotic predicament is not conducive to conversations; thus
they deserve un-listening and deliberate silencing; they are deemed
unfit to participate into the listenings of and in the city; they are
all but noise, a distraction; this chaos emerges not out of structural,
social, and political marginalization of these ears and spaces, but from
its inherent moral and ethical corruptibility; they are beyond
redemption, and thus, not unlike an erring child punished to stand out
of the classroom, they are denied recognition as citizens of the state.

The slums and its residents therefore perpetually reside in the twilight
zone of being un- citizens, loud-uncouth-noisy.

But. However. Nevertheless: the city passes. Listen. The city passes.
Lend your ears to the sound that refuses to die, dissolve and indeed
disrupts; let us then revisit the sound which got us here in the first
place: the women wailing an undead-dead, an existent non-existent.
Wailing is a sound that, in its singular utterances, colonizes the
spectrum of the triad ‘noise- sound-silence’ triad in its entirety, and
thus its highly disruptive potentialities.[^6_5]

Crying and shouting as distant cousins of this sonic performance are not
without this disruptive potential, however, these acts inherently extend
an invitation for a negotiation: either a complicity in the act,
situation, or moment responded to by crying or shouting; or, a desire to
seek redemption and retribution, and often even an acknowledgement of
guilt and penance. Wailing is a non-negotiable sonic performance.
Seemingly inarticulate in its “prolonged high-pitched cry of pain,
grief, or anger” or just as a ‘high-pitched sound’, it is in fact
unapologetic, resilient, and assured. In its so-heard incoherence, it
carries the currency of being a contaminated sound, noise; in its
effectiveness to demand attention of the ears, it is a validation of an
emotion intensely felt, a sound; and, in its transcendental potential to
silence by demanding complete hearing, it also manifests the calmness of
silence. In that: wailing comes to haunt the hearings, it disrupts the
spatial-temporal-sonic matrices as in its sonic performance its potency
to contain “noise-sound-silence” all at once. Women as systematically
muted agents—historically, politically, and sonically—performing the
wailing further lends to the anxiety: if the silenced finally start
speaking in tongues that cannot be contained and demand complete
reverence, one only wonders the wrathful gods they will evoke. The
imagery of a group of women in GP wailing onto the body of an
undead-dead uncannily evokes the predicament of the slums in the city,
here in the city of Delhi.

Superimposing the masculine/feminine binary to the cartographic reality
and imagination of the spaces in the city, slums most definitely embody
the *feminine*, and the sustained, systematic, and everyday violence
that it entails. Here, the intent of evoking the binary of masculine/
feminine to situate the real, imagined, and desired engagements between
the slums and the city is to complicate these reckonings instead of
reinforcing them[^6_6]. In their encounters with the city in different
capacities—for example, as employees, voyeurs, and consumers—the men
from the GP feel emasculated, especially in their interactions with
middle- class women as employers and objects of desire. In these
encounters, it is required of them to perform *femininity*, exaggerated
by the *silence* they have to maintain. This silencing is instituted by
the expectation of non-negotiable subservience in the case of former,
and its almost-negligible possibility of actualization in the latter.
These displaced (never disrupted though) masculinities, however, are
rehabilitated by its exaggerated, perverse hyperbolic performance within
GP’s spatiality and sociality where their position, especially vis-à-vis
women, is one of dominance. However this performance, with all its
violence, does not dissipate uncontested, remaining an exclusive domain
of the men. Women, both as individuals and occasionally, as a
collective, challenge it, whilst others (who either by the virtue of
their social position—mother-in-law, for instance—or by enjoying a
certain political legitimacy) not only embrace and internalize its
vocabulary but execute its violence on other women and weaker men. The
identified *feminine*, not necessarily a biological entity contained
within gendered qualifications, continues to be a site (both in its
pathological situation of a space and a body) where the perverse desire
to discipline, destabilize, and de- stroy can be melodramatically
performed. The anticipation lending tension to the punctum moment
accruing the *masculine-feminine* dramatics (in either its rendition of
space or body) is not a resigned deliberation of the sustenance of the
status quo, but the palpable *dread* of a conversation.

The deliberate compulsion to collapse all and every sound of the slums
in its hearing by the dominant ears—namely, the middle classes—as
contaminated and relevant only in its noisy manifestation is merely an
attempt to deny the potential of mutable sonicities. And thus to keep
the slums suspended in perpetuity as un-heard, silenced, un-dead, and
un- existent in the circus that makes the city.

However. Nevertheless: *the un-heard do wail; the un-dead do not just
cremate themselves into ashes; and the un-existent continue to move
across the spatial-temporal-sonic matrices.* In their wailing, they
haunt.[^6_7]

## Postscript
Saroj, the protagonist of the essay *The Subaltern as a Political
Voyeur*, the organic intellectual, was the undead, the hero of the hour.
She set her eyes on me as she woke up, commanding a smoke. As we walked
into the lanes, she inquired, ‘white does not really suit me, does it?’.
I wanted to but hesitated in saying it aloud, ‘neither does being dead’.

[^6_2]: I have unpacked the tensions of social and morally determined listening into the slums in Tripta Chandola, ‘Listening into Others: Moralising the Soundscapes in Delhi’, *International Development Planning Review* 34.4 (2012): 391–408 and in my doctoral research. Here, I establish the manner in which this listening not only affects the everyday interactions between the residents of the slums and their middle-class neighbours, but also the manner in which it frames the slum-dwellers as others within the imagination of the city, and its impact on urban policies that strategically exclude the spaces of slums and its residents.

[^6_3]: In the Indian context, these constructions have a historical, social, and cultural continuity, deeply embedded as they are in the practice of caste discrimination, which are essentially sensorially ordained. However, the evocation of these categories to justify the transformations of the Delhi into a world-class, global city attempts to neutralize these negotiations by rendering onto them an ahistorical, modernist agenda. This Iidentify as ‘sensorial re-turn in urban planning policies’ which I argue is, ‘\[...\]continuation of the elitist agenda to contain bodies and conquer spaces. However, the manner in which it is being executed is outside the praxis of caste, class and religion in the name of progress and development, thereby lending it a secular character, which denies it historical continuity and complexity. The sensorial re-turn is acquiring not only a political rhetoric and mainstream support, but also legal sanction’.

[^6_4]: Aside: is there a technical, clinical and, even perhaps, a cynical term for storing and sorting listening without reliance on a visual paradigm? Its reliance on a doctrine visually inclined? But then Borges was blind after all? The insertion of a blind Borges (a story-teller par excellence, but most fundamentally a custodian of knowledge in his avatar as a librarian) is to at once reveal the visual-centric bias in acknowledging and classifying experiences as knowledge cultures and practices and to emphasise that there are indeed other modalities of experiencing—evolving a ‘sense of self’—arrived at through a melee of sensorial explorations. Alberto Manguel who in his youth read to Borges when he started losing his sight, renders the experience of *experiencing* libraries, stories, and their classification with Borges as ‘memories of memories’, inadvertently displacing the visual bias in *With Borges*. The Western, Cartesian, colonial agenda of the visual bias was not without its deliberation to deny of a ‘sense of self’(by disregarding the knowledge cultures premised on a sensorial reckoning) of the encountered others—the natives. The ‘sensorial re-turn’ is but a particular and peculiar manifestation of this kind of othering.

[^6_5]: Here, the disruptive potential of wailing as a sonic performance by women in GP is identified as ‘\[...\] a scandal with the sudden intrusion, the unanticipated agency, of a female ‘object’ who inexplicably returns the glance, reverses the gaze, and contests the place and authority of the masculine position. The radical dependency of the masculine subject on the female ‘Other’ suddenly exposes his autonomy as illusory’. See Judith Butler, *Gender Trouble,* London: Routledge, 1990 (1999), pp vii. This performance further displaces the male gaze (and hearing) which Zizek identifies as ‘[...] endeavors to counter the fundamental hystericity (lie, lack of a firm position of enunciation) of the feminine speech’ by laying claims to the very vocabularies which are reckoned to render them incomprehensible, thus divesting the male gaze (and its hearings) of its autonomy. See Slavoj Zizek, *Organs without Bodies: On Deleuze and Consequences,* London: Routledge, 2004 (2012).

[^6_6]: The reactions in the Indian media and the middle-class rhetoric to the brutal Delhi Gang Rape case of 2012 are symptomatic of these negotiations. The fact that the perpetrators were residents of a slum settlement in the city distracted attention from the fundamental violence and brutality of the act of rape to the specific case being evoked as particular pathology of slumming. The materiality of this space was identified by most commentators as a breeding ground for rape. It is overpopulated; the people uneducated, and by that stretch uncouth; people here do not experience sex as a personal, emotional act, but perform it publicly; men are drunk and women lack morals. And, of course, these spaces are swarmed with those alien things: the migrants. The media was replete with such elaborations, with Sheila Dixit, the Chief Minister of Delhi then, even managing to push her deca- de long agenda of restricting the entry of migrants in the city in the kitty.

[^6_7]: The potential of wailing — as a particular sonic performance and as a more generic manifestation of the gendered, spatial and social negotiations — is identified within its capacities to occupy/claim the position of *trickster*, ‘dispelling the belief that any given social order is absolute and objective,’, who demands an audience, critical and engaged, instead of silencing this performance, potent with possibilities, by a silent reception. See Mary Douglas, 'The Social Control of Cognition: Some Factors in Joke Perception', *Man*, 3.3 (1968): 361–376.
