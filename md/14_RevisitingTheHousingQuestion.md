Reading these evocations in conjunction, it becomes evident that there
is an obvious need for new concepts, methodologies and frameworks to
capture the complexities of the newer forms of selves, inscriptions of
marginalisation and its disenfranchising impact the newer forms of
urbanites are producing. The Housing Question in the cities raised by
Engels in 1872, at the turn of the century, is still as relevant and
urgent, if not more, to ensure that both the idea of the city and the
reality of its experience continue to be sites of transformative
resilience and perhaps even propel towards the actualisation of the
‘right to the city’, as called out by Lefebvre, at the cornerstone of
which is a highly-evolved sense of participatory and emancipated sense
of ‘self’ of the urban citizens, including the urban margins.

In The Housing Question, Engels further insists that the significant
improvement in the working-class tenements in the 19th century
industrial towns was not on account of making living conditions for this
class better, but in fact to allow them just adequate sustenance levels
so as to assure their continued contribution to the exploitative
processes:

> Capitalist rule cannot allow itself the pleasure of creating epidemic
> diseases among the working class with impunity; the consequences fall
> back on it and the angel of death rages in its ranks as ruthlessly as
> in the ranks of the workers \[…\] As soon as this fact had been
> scientifically established the philanthropic bourgeois began to
> compete with one another in noble efforts on behalf of the health of
> their workers.[^8_2]

Sheila Dixit, who reigned Delhi’s ‘Clean Delhi, Green Delhi’ campaign to
put the city on the world map as a ‘world-class city’, particularly
towards hosting the Commonwealth Games, 2010, was Delhi’s Chief Minister
between 1998-2013. It was during her tenure that the city witnessed the
highest number of slum demolitions in the city particularly towards the
cleaning drive. Her justification of these demolitions on ‘humanitarian’
grounds resounds with the *‘philanthropic bourgeois’* attempts that
Engels insists on; furthermore, the grander agenda of the
‘beautification of the city’ which justified these demolitions are in
alignment of the tendencies highlighted by Engels in 1871 instead of
being an aberration. The ‘politics of aesthetics’, invisibilizing the
undesired bodies and spaces and the disciplining agendas that were
subsequently instituted were not a particularity of the Indian
neo-liberal urban spaces, post 1991 when the Indian economy was opened,
but in fact characteristic of the very mode of production of capitalism.

The body of the slum dweller, or any identified urban marginal group, in
the city is considered to inhabit illegal spaces. The notions of a
‘sacrilege centre’ inscribes on the bodies of and from the ‘vulgar
margins’. These, in turn, systematically produces an anxiety about the
‘peripheral bodies’ in the urban imaginations thus impacting and
effecting the entries of these bodies in otherwise reckoned democratic
and open spaces. By employing overt, subtle, and insidious strategies,
the imagined ‘peripheral bodies’ is subjected to civilizing and
disciplining agendas. This violence (on these bodies) at an everyday
level not only limits their agency to negotiate with the urban systems,
but also lend to perpetuating and sustaining *similar* body politic of
control and surveillance within their own contexts. And thus *spatial
agency* as a basic right towards equitable urban futures to calibrate
*space in the city remains un-actualized* when *space of the body* – as
a fundamental assertion of one’s identity in the city – itself becomes
‘heterotopias of deviation’.

And here, the testimonies of Bharti, Praveen Bhaaji and Nagma, and
similar accounts, which inform my position, further complicates the
methodological approaches and interventions in addressing the housing
concerns for the urban margins. The predicament of those on the urban
margins - the slum dwellers, the residents of the resettlement colonies,
the migrants, the homeless - is caught in the cul-de-sac of their
bodies’ labour desired for the task that goes into the ‘beautification
of the city’, and in fact in running the meticulous, exploitative
machinery of the city, however the presence of these bodies evokes
disgust. Thus: the space of the body of those on the urban margins and
the body of the space (by the way of the sight of the slums, the
homeless squatters and similar spaces) both are haunted by the spectre
of precarity, vulnerability and illegality. Without taking into
cognizance the lived experience and realities of the urban poor, the
methodologies and approaches informing the housing policies and plans
for the same will continually and cyclically endure the fate of Engel’s
prediction of being ‘merely shifted elsewhere’. Bharti’s testimony from
a resettlement colony is but an affirmation of this finding fruition.

Housing is not merely a matter of infrastructural concern. Particularly
for the urban poor who are amongst the most marginalised and precarious
constituent groups in the cities, the ease, access and availability of
adequate housing is determinant in not only shaping their present but
also securing their future and long-term aspirations. The existing
approach is limited by the very *limited* manner in which it engages
with the ‘real housing conditions’ for the in the cities. The future
research design and focus needs to consider the capacities existing and
needed to ensure sustainable, livable futures (with focus on housing
demands/needs/conditions) in the city among the urban poor. And the
manner in which housing issues impact not only the present but also
actualisation of future aspirations for the informal sector in the
workers. One of the key ways in which these research can contribute to
policy discussions is by generating data sets, insights and
understandings to inform and define parameters for what ‘livable and
inclusive’ cities for this constituent section of the population in the
city means. A key lacunae in understanding the ‘livability’ for the
urban poor is the lack of, or very limited, insights available to
capture the overall ‘well-being’ - social, cultural, psychological -
encountered by the urban poor as articulated by themselves.

The lived experiences of the urban poor, more often than not, fail to
find way into policy framing and considerations. The fault line lies not
so much in the ‘intentions’ but the methodological and conceptual
approaches which inform these studies. In my doctoral thesis, drawing on
a five-year long ethnographic research in the Govindpuri slums, I
proposed *listening* as a methodological intervention to engage with the
everyday negotiations of its residents. It recounts the experiences and
encounters of the slum-dwellers in relation to the space they inhabit.
The fulcrum to engage with these narratives was the practice of
*listening*, privileging what, how, when and why the slum-dwellers
listen in and into. The matter of agreeing upon *listening(s)* as a
trope of engagement with the slum-dwellers about their everyday was not
intentional and strategic; instead whilst 'hanging around' the slums the
intent, urgency and anxiety amongst the residents to articulate their
sense of selves employing their own referential vocabulary was realised
in their listening practices.

'hanging around' the slums the intent, urgency and anxiety amongst the
residents to articulate their sense of selves employing their own
referential vocabulary was realised in their listening practices.

In that sense: in my research I was not only keen on what the residents
of the slums were *listening into,* but also – both as a methodological
and political position – to privilege the ‘ears’ of the slum-dwellers.

These *listening(s)* of the slum-dwellers into their everyday practices
also allowed insights into the wider social, cultural, spatial,
emotional, sensorial and political cosmos of the slum. The importance is
exaggerated as these insights about the slum-dwellers rarely find their
way into the official *sarkari or* bureaucratic records. The
*listening(s)* of the slum-dwellers then not only complements the
readings of the official records but also complicates them. It does so
by inserting and amplifying the *voice* of the marginalized,
disenfranchised poor by considering and recognizing their position in
the city, its broader urban planning policies and socio-cultural
fabrics, as actualized, appropriated and critiqued by them. Insisting on
these *listening(s)* also lends to a broader political mandate by
extending a self-reflexive agency to the slum-dwellers, allowing them a
platform to comment on what they make of *what* (by which I mean
policies, popular middle-class imaginations, public discourse) is done
to them. In short, whilst we know enough about what is done to the urban
poor, these *listening(s)* **in fact** allow us to hear into what the
urban poor do about what is done to them. The importance of these
*listening(s)* is paramount in extending a ‘voice’ to the marginalized
to identify and articulate their own demands depending on the lived
experiences which continually expose their vulnerability of systemic,
structural and immediate concerns.

The methodological framework of listening allows for these lived
realities become a key focus on how poor communities organize and
navigate precarity shape existing governance capacities and alter urban
poverty as a way of life towards resilient, inclusive and sustainable
futures. Towards truly achieving the mandate of ‘Right to the City’, it
is essential to develop critical insights into whether spatial ‘access’
translates into the constituent population being able to accrue
long-term material, social and cultural capital for a more consolidated
‘well-being’ in the city. The policy framing, actionable investments and
future research needs to direct its efforts towards meeting the housing
and living conditions for the urban poor in a holistic manner, such that
this constituent group of city’s residents can also claim these spaces
as their ‘homes’ with pride, dignity, self-respect and assurance.

The last two decades have witnessed the landscapes of the Indian cities
undergoing significant transformations. For both the long-term residents
and the newer-arrivals, these urban landscapes are at once sites
allowing possibilities for realities and aspirations erstwhile
unimaginable to be actualized and spaces where social, structural and
systemic violence and discriminations are strategically reproduced and
reinforced. The re-calibrating sites, processes and manifestations of
violence, disenfranchisement and marginalization in the transforming
urban landscapes also necessitate theoretical, methodological and
political interventions towards the project of democratic, just and
equitable futures for the city as spaces and sites of ethical
cohabitation.

To end, perhaps at a polemical (and also pessimistic) tone, considering
a disruption in the capitalist mode of production, which as Engels
identified will only continue to reproduce the question of the housing
for the urban poor, is not an imminent reality and which thus also
limiting the actualization of the ‘Right to the City’ and thereby
possibility resilient urban futures. After all, if there is an ongoing
contestation of claims to spaces, identities and sense of ‘self’ for the
urban poor in the manner in which they never really become ‘urban’, as
identified by Lefebrve, in that, ‘they come to see participation not as
speaking at a public hearing or serving on a citizens’ panel, but as the
living struggle for a city that is controlled by its inhabitants’, how
does one truly envisage extending the capacities to the urban poor to
empower them into resilient futures?

And, here methodologically, I want to make a rather bold intervention:
whilst it is of utmost significance to *listen into* the lived and
experienced realities of the urban poor and to constantly employ
innovative methodological tools to inform policy, there is also an
urgent need to add another constituent group in the city in the
endeavours of educating them: the middle-classes. Resounding through
Nagma’s prescient question, *what will they do without us,* the
middle-classes need to be made brutally cognizant of the fact that their
modern, clean, sanitized, world-class claims and desires for the city
will in fact remain a distant dream if the urban poor are not given
dignified and equitable presence in their imagination, encounters and
reality. It is only when everyone in the city is recognised as its
*inhabitants* that urban resilient futures will be actualised.

Lastly, in revisiting the housing question which is yet to be realised,
one cannot overlook the first, foremost and fundamental question: *for
whom and towards what futures* are the Smart, World-Class, and Resilient
cities being imagined?

The spectres that haunt the very livability of the urban poor are yet to
be resolved, and which then compels the reckoning that instead of
propelling towards smartness, beautification and resilience what is of
urgency is to recognise across registers the complex and delicate
manners in which conditions of precarity are intertwined such that the
burden of resilient, ethical co-habitational spaces is a collective
endeavour and responsibility.
