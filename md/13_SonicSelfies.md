# 7. Sonic Selfies: Equalizing the Encounter with the Other 

In conversation with Jodi Dean (JD) and Geert Lovink (GL).[^7_1]

**GL:** **For many cultural critics, the selfie is a symbol for
neo-liberal self-promotion. There is a constant pressure to perform, to
show-off, be present. The selfie embodies the desperate attempt by the
‘failed individual’ to show that she (or he) still in the rat race: I am
alive, don’t forget me, look at me and think of me, next time you can do
me a favour \[…\] But first, how do we deal with the selfie phenomena
beyond forced participation or moral accusation, and develop ways of
seeing that integrate machine readable interpretations?**

It is a winter afternoon in the jhuggis. Whilst Delhi summers evoke
kindness of a very particular kind, the winters bring a peculiar
conviviality. And thus in one of the lanes of one of the camps, where I
am also present, just hanging about, this conviviality is performed in
all its loudness. However, there is a moment of rupture in the din of
conversations, casual banters, conflicting musical performances, an old
woman with frizzled hair rather casually lifts her arse, in full sight,
and let out a garrulous fart, brrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaar. A moment’s silence
followed with an equally loud collective laugh, but it was not to
embarrass or make the old woman conscious. She shifted her arse back to
the comfortable position, taking her time.

Retrospectively, I think that was the moment when I started thinking of
sonic performances as particular ‘individuated moments’ of establishing
and extending one’s sense of self and space. This was much before the
‘selfie’ days, Smartphones had not yet invaded the everyday life. From
my middle-class location, this public performance of a very ‘private’
sonic moment (which I distinctly remember being taught to curb,
especially in public), I was intrigued. The slums are highly gendered
space, and especially women’s mobility and performative potentialities
in every regards comes under intense scrutiny. However, the old woman on
account of her age had accrued permissions which are otherwise limited
to the young women, and thus the permission without the embarrassment. A
transgressive space is thus claimed and created.

I retrospectively attribute ‘sonic Selfies’ as a framework to locate the
individuated moments of sonic performances, particularly of the
identified Others, which when located within listening as a
methodological and political intervention exposes the potential to
displace, disturb and disrupt the ‘encounter’ in the Althusserian
sense.[^7_2] And thus from my almost two decades of listening into the
slums of Govindpuri, I highlight other encounters which the sonic
selfies necessitated, which I later extrapolate to macro-level
encounters from the everydayness of the jhuggis. The insistence on
recounting the sonic selfie encounters with the slums is to disrupt the
imagination of the slums, or perhaps any people, spaces and ideas on the
margins, as homogenised, flattened existences.

A young girl, not a day more than 15, from a conservative family, who
insist on ‘controlling’ her mobilities and bodily spatialities and
performances. She practices the ultimate defiance by insisting on
adorning a pair of jeans, a forbidden epitome of ‘modern’ ways reckoned
unbecoming by her family. She is beaten, abused, threatened with dire
consequences by her mother and brother, but she asserts her ‘sonic
selfie’ by a stoic muted, silent response. She does not retort. When
hit, she does not even cry, even though the tears streaming down her
face evidence to the momentum of the movement of the hand that landed on
her frail cheeks. But neither her silence or the jeans she is wearing
can be taken away from her. After a while, the family members relent.
And in the days, months, years, as I saw that young girl accumulating
years, her styling of her jeans just got better.

I can go on to list such moments in some length, but those are replete
in the other essays in the book. I want to return to GL’s evocation of
the ‘moral accusation’ and ‘failed individual’ which the creation and
circulation of ‘sonic selfies’ via mediated technologies, smartphones to
be precise, brought on to the residents of the slums as a constitutive
representative others in the broader urban imagination.

Sonic selfies as a moment of individuated performative sonic selves and
claiming of spaces by the others, here the residents of the jhuggis,
induce anxiety, particularly when performed in the shared public spaces,
which within the hegemonic imagination needs to absented of the
presences of these others. When the ‘sonic selfies’ were merely limited
to bodily presences and performances, there were adequate strategies
of silencing, disciplining and absenting these performances from these
hegemonic spaces.[^7_3]

The mediated sonic selfies, particularly the extensive usage of the
smartphones to listen to music, have ‘loud’ conversations over the phone
in public spaces - malls, metro, amongst others, and the performative
presence of the others of using the ‘same’ kind of technology, namely
the Smartphones, exacerbated newer forms of ‘anxiety of proximity’ with
the others. Unlike the ‘second visuality’ of selfie communism which
images produce, as JD insists, these mediated ‘sonic selfies’ are not as
easily to be ignored, absented and silenced.

Before proceeding with the transgressive capacities of the ‘sonic
selfies’, a pause is in askance to locate these tendencies in the
broader context of the bureaucratic-technocratic imaginations of
locating the other.

In 2013, the Government of India released a report, ‘Housing Stock,
Amenities & Assets in Slums—Census 2011'.[^7_4] In this report, along with
the access to potable water and sanitation facilities to the slum
dwellers, it accounts the ‘number of households availing banking
services and number of households having each of the specified assets’.
These assets include, amongst others, mobile phones. I wrote an
article responding to the media coverage, particularly focussing on
the usage of mobile phones in the slums.[^7_5] The manner in which articles in
mainstream media articulated these data sets is quite revealing of the
popular perceptions of ‘slumming’ in the cities. They were nothing short
of being virulent. Consider these: ‘Amenities in slums match up to urban
homes \[…\] India’s first-ever census of household amenities and assets in
slums has revealed that slum dwellers are also spending more on TV sets,
computers and mobile phones rather than sanitation’[^7_6] in one, and the
following in another: ‘34 per cent in slums have no toilet, but 63 per
cent own mobile phone \[…\] Depending on how one looks at it, “slumming
it” may just have acquired a whole new meaning — either most Indian towns
live the life of slums or the quality of life in slums is
improving’.[^7_7]

In both these articulations the tension to reckon the slum dwellers as
‘consumers’ is contemptuously palpable. The first blatantly overlooks
the structural factors leading to the systematic lack of sanitation
facilities in slums, which in fact is a state responsibility, by
shifting the onus on to the slum dwellers for not tackling these issues;
it is also clearly disapproving of the fact that the slum dwellers spend
more assets clearly meant for ‘entertainment’ than investing in
‘improving’ their everyday conditions. The second articulation, more
subtle in its tonality, at the outset sets out the anxiety of sharing
the same ‘consumerist-cultural’ space with the slums.

I juxtapose these reckoning with my experience and involvement from the
early 2000’s in the Open Source Movement in India and ICT4D project, the
heydays of the obscene celebration of new media technologies with
perverse potentials. Interestingly, in those days my issues (and
eventual departure) with the ICT4D movements and projects was not a
response far from my more recent articulation. Then, it was reckoned,
and I loosely articulate my own perspective on these initiatives, ‘seek
out the poor, marginalised people and spaces, equip them with one or the
other fancy new media technologies - computers, phones and such - and
teach them life skills, and lo behold, their lives will improve’. In
both these reckoning of the ‘poor’ - the eternal other - are denied any
foundational sense of ‘self’ wherein they can make ‘informed’ choices,
whether it be about what life skills and technologies might be most
useful or in their capacities as ‘consumers’ who in fact make an
informed choice about spending their own money on technologies,
particularly smartphones, just to have *fun*.

The issue I had with such a reckoning that the sole and singular mandate
of these initiatives leaned towards a ‘utilitarian’ use of the new media
technologies for the poor and thus further ‘rendering technical’ the
terms of these engagements, such that, ‘\[f\]irst, they reposed
political-economic causes of poverty and injustice in terms of amenable
to a technical solution. Second, they highlighted only those problems
for which a technical solution in fact be proposed'.[^7_8] These
initiatives were beyond the concerns of the fact these were a strategic
way for the State to absolve of its own responsibilities by outsourcing
them to these funding organisations and, more importantly, these were
insidious ways for the capitalist agendas (which usually also
inadvertently served the purposes of the funding organisations) to enter
into erstwhile unidentified, untapped markets and to impose a certain
form of governmentality.[^7_9]

In the aforementioned article, I argued, and I quote at some length for
its set the backdrop to ‘develop ways of listening’ into the ‘sonic
selfie’ phenomena.

The anxiety-inducing tendency has to be located in the broader context
of the position of the others - in their corporeal presences but also in
imaginative potentialities. But when the other announces herself in
fully glory, the summer causally swaging in her hips, singing a song she
desires - however out of tune and unharmonious - walks the same paths as
the hegemonic self, the latter quite literally loses the plot. And sets
about to imagine other ways to summon, discipline the other.

I thus propose ‘sonic selfies’ as a conceptual framework, in all its
loudness and corporeality, as moment of displacing, disturbing and
rupturing the aspirations and imaginations of the tapestry of the
hegemonic self whilst also dislocating the sites where power, control
and violence could be exerted. In that, the ‘sonic selfies’ compel an
equalising moment, however momentarily, in the encounter with the other.
I also remain astutely and cynically aware, and thus do not overemphasis
on these practices to compel structural changes, set in motion a
revolutionary momentum, and I am not averse to admitting that these
‘equalising moments of encounter’ might only be compelled by matters of
compulsions. However, the encounters with the Other does not need to be
predicated on the premise of ‘love thy neighbour’ but a mutual, mutable
respectability to not silence them. The ‘sonic selfies’ have compelled
such an encounter wherein the Other cannot be muted, and the hegemonic
self has to listen, however grudgingly. Because, the ears, they never
close and thus insisting on a collective listening project of the selves
of the others.

**GL: The object watches us: the selfie is watching back \[…\] Selfies
can be read as proofs of utter presence, not as evidence of electronic
solitude, let alone a symptom of a personality disorder; they do not
exemplify who we are but show that we exist, at this very moment.**

**JD: We should take this point to its logical extreme, selfies are a
communist form of expression, social products appropriated by
capitalism, now of course the critical reflex is to dismiss selfies as
yet another indication of a pervasive culture of narcissism, I disagree.
The narcissism, the narcissism critique approaches the selfie as if it
were analysing a single photograph, it views the person in that
photograph as the photograph subject. Selfies though should be
understood as a common form emerging out of the communicative practices
of secondary visuality. Understood from within this practices, the
selfie has a collective subject, the many participating in the common
practice, the many imitating each other, the figure in the photo is
incidental. So, a selfie is a photo when makes of oneself using a mobile
phone in order to share the photo on social media, it exists digitally
in that weird in between of instant and forever, it’s not meant as a
commemoration, it doesn't memorialize what we’ve done, it's a quick
registration of what we're doing.**

A confession is in order: compared to most, I am a novice when it comes
to the use of Smartphones. I only acquired one, and that too as a gift
from a friend, in 2017. Until then, I carried a Nokia 1100, which cost
as much, and had none of the ‘smart’ capacities. I carried the phone
‘un-smart’ phone, almost as a chip on my shoulder, an announcement of a
counter-cultural statement: I refuse to participate in the obscene,
perversity of over-connectedness, indulgence in the ‘self’, and
resigning myself to the diktats of the market. I would often remark, and
not without a certain self-congratulatory moralising, partronizing tone,
that integral to the identities of the young girls, with whom I shared
momentary space whilst traveling in the ladies compartment of the Delhi
metro, are the three *S’s: Skinny jeans, Smartphones and Selfies.* I was
both intrigued and exasperated with this project of having ‘oneself
stare back at itself’. I am the child of socialist India, where
acquiring a landline was a bureaucratic battle, and its usage permitted
none of the immediacy, intimacy, privacy and unimaginable connectedness
(or perhaps dis-connectedness of connections) which the smartphones
allow.

The pervasive takeover by the Smartphones in Govindpuri also amused me,
though perhaps I was gentler in my critique. But, there was one. I
remember returning from Australia in early 2015, and as had become the
habit over the years, one of my first visits would be to the jhuggis,
carrying gifts and presents not from some distant lands, but often the
‘non-place’ sites of the duty free shops. Amidst the catching up, the
food, celebrations, I found the ‘gang of girls’ - all in early 20s, more
or less - with whom I shared more personal and intimate relationships,
huddled and having hushed conversations in the corner. I interrupted and
inquired whether another of their assignations was being plotted, and
feigned irritation at being left out. Seethu, whom I had first seen as a
young, confident teenager, had by now acquired a job in a fashion
merchandising firm and who regaled all by her ‘out-worldly’ adventures,
said, ‘well, Didi, no, no, there is nothing we are planning of that
sort, and if we were, we would need you. But this is something
different, I hope you don’t take it any other way, but we were planning
to pool in money to buy you a proper phone. We think you might be having
some money issues’. I was tad bit amused, but mostly flattered by their
attention. I told them, I was perfectly happy with my non-smart phone, I
had no use for it. I used the phone for what it is meant to do, and not
everything else. These ‘smartphone’ toys were for the young ones.

And over the years, I was fascinated by the increasing use of the
Smartphones (hereafter, SPs) in the jhuggis, particularly the young
girls. I was not engaged so much in their agendas and projects of
‘presenting and performing’ themselves, but identified the usage of
smartphones as emerging sites of 'feminine' assertions – in terms of
romances, venturing into external networks, etc. – especially as cyber
cafes, when they were really prevalent and popular were essentially
masculine spaces. And, secondly, the manner in which the inherent
capabilities of the smartphones was allowing to circumvent the text
based, literate modality of engagement which the non-smart phones did
not allow.

On every visit to GP, I found myself more and more intricately seduced
into this world of non-text, verbal, visual mode of ways of being,
making meaning the residents of the slums, particularly women, were
venturing into. What was most fascinating for me was the manner in which
a certain kind of de-colonization of the erstwhile otherwise
reckoned-democratic, but still elitist, space of the Internet was being
achieved by the constant and consistent presence the others were etching
onto it. Through the various social media platforms, these others - the
mostly illiterate, lacking technical skills and technological tools,
residents of GP - were inserting their ‘footprints’, so to say, on this
uncharted territory to become producers in their own right, instead of
merely consumers. These others silenced and absented in this space were
making their noises, without inhibitions and much aplomb, and like how!

One particular aspect of the claiming of these uncharted territories,
modes and modalities of being, performances was the use of WhatsApp
voice messaging feature in the smartphones which caught my imagination
and intrigue. Within the scope of the retrospectively attributed framing
of ‘sonic selfies’ whose canvas, so to say, is much broader, here I want
to insist on the practices of using this particular feature to respond,
and perhaps even modestly further the disruptive potential of ‘selfies’
as ‘communist form of expression’ and ‘as proofs of utter
presence’.[^7_13]

I also draw on my experience of producing, creating and consuming ‘sonic
selfies’ - via the WhatsApp voice feature - which has exploded my
relationship with the ‘field’, already firm and solid, into a sonic
constellation of a kind of commoning which could not be performed
earlier. And it is in this capacity of commoning is that I locate the
possibilities of ‘communist form of expression’ to be sophisticated.
Most of my closest and oldest associates here have never received formal
education and autodidacts in their own rights; in fact, it is to these I
owe the hacks into a lot of applications and their potential to which I
remained blissfully unaware. Until I was not available on the WhatsApp,
the communications had to have a certain preparedness: what time, missed
calls, low credit balance and other such considerations. The WhatsApp
voice feature, a gesture which in its physicality requires a flattening,
has disrupted, displaced and ruptured the matrix of the
spatial-temporality-physicality of our encounters. And I insist on this
particular feature of the WhatsApp to emphasise on ‘sonic selfies’
because in my encounters with my middle-class, educated, mostly
upper-caste, rarely Muslim collegiate (a slice of the hegemonic self,
perhaps) via WhatsApp, this feature is rarely, if never, used. Our
exchanges are text-based and visually orientated.


And thus: a young woman, with no formal education, ensues a romantic
liaison with a man - who knows of what age - whom she met surfing one of
the social media platforms by sending him voice messages. Sometimes he
would send text, which she would rush to her friends who could read to
be translated. And recorded an adequate response. He was, as she found
out, an engineer, living in a not so far off middle-class settlement. He
never questioned her intent to not respond by text messages, because
when he did send her a text to say he was busy or could not talk, she
would compensate the ‘silence’ with an emoji reflecting her reaction:
sad face, its OK face, thumbs up! She sustained and circulated an idea
about herself, a mirror reflection, akin to Narcissus but unlike him not
succumbing to it even to be the golden flower, and thus allowing herself
simultaneously to announce her presence but also transcend it. And is
not transcendence the fundamental essence of claiming the ‘self’ in most
fundamental Marxist sense towards a collective, unalienated Utopia?
Perhaps the deception was dually performed, he was not who he said, but
does it matter? This medium - an equalising encounter with the Other -
activated by ‘sonic’ exchanges allowed both of them to go ‘beyond the
given reality, the world as it is, overcoming it practically,
conceptually and ideologically'.[^7_14]

In the essay, *An Obscene Calling*, I called out the tendencies of the
hegemonic self to deny ‘emotionality’ to the other. Without extending
too much importance solely on the WhatsApp voice message feature, I
evoke it more in an illustrative sense to highlight the manner in which
this feature allowed a ‘voice’ to the emotions which otherwise remained
unactualized. Baby, of whom I also spoke in that essay and another
essay, *Subaltern as a Political Voyeur*, in the present has finally
left the services of the Tamil Brahmin household she had been with for
the last twenty years. She articulated her decision thus:

> Over the years, I have bitten my tongue on all kinds of humiliations
> they pelted on to me. Because it suited their interest, they presumed
> me to be Hindu, and such was their indifference, but also authority,
> that I had no choice to play the game. I am not complaining, they did
> a lot for the family. But I am talking more about the humiliations at
> the everyday level. Of course, there were no prescribed days of leave
> or off, and god forbid, if I chose to take one day off, the bloody
> Madam would make feel like a worm, and then giving me stale leftovers
> and me having to show gratitude for doing so. I had to constantly be

The ‘voice’ that the said feature allows to the unactualized emotions
are not limited to only the encounters with the hegemonic self as the
other of the Other, the residents of the jhuggis find ingenious ways to
use this feature to express their emotionality within their own life
worlds. Whether it be in regards to communicating displeasure over a
lover paying undue attention to another by sending a ‘silent’ recorded
message, or to tell an estranged brother that in spite of the loud,
brutal recriminations and altercations, the love is still there.

Perhaps Baby’s instance sets up a notion that all encounters with the
other of the other are tense and acrimonious, and the WhatsApp voice
feature allows to perform and exert one’s presence whilst subtracting
‘real time’ implications. There are enough instances to illustrate that
these ‘sonic selfies’ - mediated via the WhatsApp voice feature - allow,
in my reckoning, an equalising (not necessarily always translating into
equitable, ethical co-habitational spaces) plane for the other to assert
their ‘presences’ to announce that they are in fact ‘present’ in the
same space-time continuum, that they in fact cannot be absented. Of
course, the same WhatsApp voice feature which enables this ‘equalising
encounter’ also comes with the capability to ‘block’ or ‘unlisten’ to
these ‘sonic selfies’. However, that conditions is predated by the fact
that the ‘presence’ has been inserted and performed.

In that, I find myself seduced by the possibilities of an ‘equalising
encounter’ of the voice feature of WhatsApp, whose imagined and intended
usage has been extended in its appropriation to be claimed to announce
‘presences’, form ‘collectives’ and practice commoning erstwhile
unavailable on the same technological platforms to the identified
others. In this essay, whilst the inspiring anchor remains the everyday
negotiations of and with the residents of the GP, the other I evoke is
the constituent group of people who are denied, structurally and
systemically, to participate in knowledge production, consumption,
circulation, recalibration and disruption processes. In that the ‘voice’
that the said feature allows has implications more far reaching than
just matters of utterances, it opens possibilities of a collectivization
which has been denied to this group. The denial of the self to the
others, of course, is the foundational premise which does not even
permit this group to participate in the ‘pervasive cultures of
narcissism’.

Within the hegemonic project, the self of the other is a muted entity.
It refuses to recognise among the others the otherwise celebrated
contours and curvatures which the hegemonic self so callously either
claims, disrupts or denies as a matter of right and choice (my own
resistance to Smartphone being a pathetic testimony to this tendency).
The hegemonic project does not want the others to be complex entities,
but static receptors without the capacities to transmit.

And thus I evoke ‘sonic selfies’, one of its particular manifestation -
the use of WhatsApp Voice feature in Smartphones - as an illustrative
instance which has evidenced the transcendental, transgressive potential
to sustain ruptures in the anxiety-ridden distancing, silencing
absenting agenda of the hegemonic forces with the encounter with the
other.

The task at hand for those of us who listen, but also have the
capacities - however limited in the broader schematic of insidious
capitalist subordination - is to activate these sites of ‘equalising
encounters’, even at the cost of disrupting, displacing and disturbing
our own positions within the comfortable womb of the hegemonic self we
so often find ourselves curling into in foetal positions when the
encounter with others becomes too real, too anxious, too neurotic.

**JD: One does not replace or subordinate the other, they intermix mash
and mingle, such that neither alone can be said to be the repository of
truth, because images circulate as conversations, we find ourselves
engaging in a new communicative form where the originality or uniqueness
of an image is less important than its common generic qualities, the
qualities that let it circulate quickly and easily that make it
contagious \[…\] It marks a contagious intensity, something about which
people have strong feelings, crowds in squares and in media are
generally diverse and tumultuous, imitation, repetition, contagion do
not imply agreement.**

There are days, whilst visiting Govindpuri, even at the cost of not
making appointments at the said time, I often find myself sat on the
road under the Govindpuri metro station, the closest one to reach to the
jhuggis. It is an overhead metro station, and the road over which Delhi
metro’s tentacles spread is one of the main arterial roads leading to
dense industrial areas of Okhala and further edges of the city. I sit
here in my quietness, sipping a tea, rolling a smoke, revelling in the
‘intermix mash and mingle’ of the ‘sonic selfies’ which are reckoned to
render this moment in space-time continuum a ‘noisy’ bearing.

Here, a pushcart with his frail attendant cries out to have his way
cleared; a man in a SUV, with rolled up windows and AC on full blast
(whose heat can be heard from a distance) keeps his hands on his horn,
because he cannot hear the din he is making; a public transport bus in
which many a lives will perhaps lose a dime or an opportunity because of
the delay, announces a rather masculine sonic intervention of its desire
to have its way; in the same bus, perhaps there is a young couple, I
find myself hoping, who are only finding out they are in love, and which
they know is forbidden, indulge in silent, slight touches amidst the
demonic dances of the ‘sonic selfies’. Here, the possibility to ‘shut
out’ is absent, and thus ‘shutting out and absenting’ of the Other
itself not an option. The multiplicity of the ‘sonic selfies’ - whether
they be the frail cries, or amplified horns, the clanking of the cycle
rickshaws which itself creates its own moment, the music that plays from
someone having a conversation on speaker mode on their mobiles, or just
using their mobiles as transmitter of songs of love and longing, or
simply lust. Or even those who lend to this ‘intermix mash and mingle’
in their silences - necessitate a moment, however momentarily, to
cohabit, to acknowledge the ‘presences’ of the others, however
unpalatable it might be to their sense of selves, to respect the logics
of the collectivization that compels an accommodation which otherwise
would be negotiated, distanced and/or silenced.

The poetics of the moment burst me into raptures of an equally poignant
political possibilities. And I want to shout out to no one in particular
and everyone in general, a spectre is haunting the world, the spectre of
othering. Let us abandon our seats as silent spectators in this
theatrics of the world drama wherein an identified other is maimed,
raped, burned, silenced without an apology in full view. Let us make the
noise.
