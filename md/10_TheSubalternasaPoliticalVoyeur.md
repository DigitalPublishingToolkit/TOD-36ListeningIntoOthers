## The Rally: Politics at the Crossroads

It is a fine February evening, in more than one ways. I am at the
intersection, yet again. But not a researcher, not awaiting someone to
come and accompany me into the slums. There is no scheduled interview. I
am not a researcher in and at the moment. I am wading along with the
jubilant, intense, some inebriated crowds to celebrate the sweeping,
historic[^4_2] victory for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for the 6th Delhi
legislative assembly elections. I share the chorus and chants for the
party's victory, and rejoice in the announcements by the residents of
the slums of Govindpuri that ‘this is **our** victory’, ‘it is **our**
*sarkar* \[government\]’, and ‘now it **our** responsibility to ensure
that the government functions properly’.

The intersection cuts across the Navjeevan and Bhumhiheen camps, on
either side, and meets with the road leading into its
posher-distant-cousins of settlements, Alaknanda, Chittranjan Park and
further into the Greater Kailash territory. Alongside the road, on whose
either side’s slumming spreads out on to it, also are a few middle-class
apartment blocks, Kohinoor and Konark. This road encircles the Navjeevan
and Nehru camps. A trip down this road is for many – uninitiated,
apprehensive and vicariously inclined – the most intimate they get with
the slums. Lacking open spaces within the slums, the encircling road
becomes the arena for the residents of these slums: here, the children
come out to play, wares are sold, people hang about, and markets spread
out. This blatant, unapologetic slumming evokes diverse reactions from
the middle-class neighbours.

A lady, residents of Kohinoor apartment and a professor of political
science in a women’s college in Delhi, articulated it thus:

> I moved into these apartments 20 years back, the price was affordable
> because of there were these slums. But we were assured that they will
> be soon relocated. I am all for the dignity of the poor, and they
> should get proper houses, but does it have to be here? Never in my
> entire stay here have I walked this road \[leading to the
> intersection, passing along the slums\]. And in the last few years
> what with the air-conditioning in the car, I don’t even have to roll
> down the windows. That such a relief.

When further asked had she ever been into slums and how did she reckon
the residents their lived like, ‘hell no, I have never been inside. And
I bet they live packed sardines’. Another residents of the Konark
apartments, also a petitioner in the Public Interest Litigation (PIL)
which sought to remove the slums, whilst maintaining that the presence
of the slums accounted for the nuisance levels (including the
embarrassment it caused to the middle-class residents) admitted that,
‘the presence of the slums, and its people on the roads, lends to the
vibrancy in this area and also makes it cheaper for us to live here’.

The intersection then is an important landmark for both the residents of
the slums and its visitors. During my initial research days, when I
still was not acquainted with the geography of the inner-lanes in the
camps and moved into these spaces with certain apprehension, it was here
at the intersection – *maachi market waali red light \[*red light
outside the fish market\] *–* that I was met with by the residents. In
that, the intersection and the road leading into the slums are the main
arterial link with the world of slums and slumming for those variously
interested: research, activism and politics.

During the time of the elections – Municipal, State, Centre – the road
assumes a renewed importance. The politicians keen to seek the voter
support base of the slums without really slumming it out – venturing
into the lanes of slums – to reach out to the residents. The park,
adjoining the communal toilets on the Bhumhiheen camp side of the road
and Konark apartment block, becomes the congregation grounds during the
times of election. And thus it was not a surprise the victory rally for
Avaatar Singh rode along this road.

I begin with this event to enliven the vibrant, dense and contested
political landscapes the urban poor inhabit. Here, to celebrate AAP’s
historic victory or undertaking a catharsis of this event as a metaphor
is not the intent. The centre-stage is the marginalized space of the
slums in the city, and the attention steadfastly remains on the urban
poor – here, resident of the Govindpuri slums as representative of that
constituency. The poor as an electoral constituency remain an enigma for
most political parties, commentators and pundits during elections at any
jurisdictional level – national, state, municipal: why do the poor cast
their vote? And what determines their allegiance? Patronage? The
‘freebies’? The communal evocations? The caste rhetoric?

The literature, as well as non-poor commonsensical reckoning, abound
with interjections, inquisitions and ‘explanations’ towards this end:
why do the poor vote? However poignant and penetrating these analyses
there is not an absolute answer to this question, and each election
result compels a new set of questions and interjections. And thus how
could not I, as an ethnographer and interlocutor of the lives on the
margins for more than a decade, not feel arrogant enough to undertake
the task, to once and for, answer the overwhelming question, why do the
poor vote?

## The Ethnographer at the Crossroads: Interrogating the Politics of the Subaltern 

Politics is omnipresent, and as an atheist, it is in the realm of the
political, first and foremost and fundamentally, that I locate the
consolidation of one's position within the broader, intersecting
matrices of social, cultural, religious, amongst others. However as an
ethnographer in/of marginalised spaces, in the initial years of my
forays in GP, I found myself hesitant to openly discuss the politics.
Indeed: the focus of the research being undertaken then did not
foreground the political lives of the poor. However, I saw politics of
caste, communal, regional and gendered strategically negotiated and
performed within material realities of the slums, and in turn also
lending to give its particular characteristic. But also, that these very
lens informed the negotiations (and relationships) of the slum-dwellers
with the middle-class residents and spaces which are, more often than
not, predicated on the former being allowed to occupy only a subservient
position. And thus in encounters as such, complex and complicated
trajectories were revealed through which the political self – manifest
in one’s caste, communal, gender, regional identities – were calibrated,
emphasized, negotiated and/or subverted.

Baby has been working in an upper-caste, Tamilian household for the last
twenty years as a domestic worker. When she first went to seek the job,
she was mistaken for a Hindu widow, given the fact that her body was not
marked by the symbolisms which establish the marital status within the
Hindu cosmos; namely, absence of a *mangalsutra, bindi* and bangles. Her
employer, a chaste, upper-caste woman, not only felt kindly towards
Baby, but also hired her at a rate higher than the going one at that
time. During the last twenty years, the family has looked after Baby and
her extended family with some consideration, often paying when health
and education needs in the family demanded investment.

Baby has immense respect for the family. In recounting the chastity of
the household, she talks with certain reverence about their highly
meticulous abstemious practices, especially, in regards to food. They
don’t eat garlic, onions, definitely no meat of any kind. Considering
Baby cooks for them as well, they are convinced she shares their
food-beliefs. Often at this moment of telling, she cannot help being
naughty to wonder aloud, ‘how the hell did these people with so much
money, intelligence and education, just could not figure it out all
these years’. Baby’s real name is Chandbibi, who in the neighbourhood is
known for her delicious buffalo-meat kebabs.

Saroj, of whom I shall speak at length later, was a formidable
politician in Navjeevan camp. She hailed from a lower-caste village in
Uttar Pradesh, but since her early teens had been a resident of Delhi.
One hot, summer afternoon I was visiting her house. We sat on the
*charpoy* in the lane, outside her *jhuggi.*[^4_3] Through the open door I
could see a house sparsely and cleanly organised, the shades were drawn
and from where I was in the heat, the coolness of it was very enticing.
But no such invitation was extended, and thus we sat outside, smoking
(she, *beedi* and I, rollies; and often sharing each other’s).[^4_4]An
hour or so into the conversation I asked for water, the throat was
parched, the heat overwhelming, I was losing focus. Saroj sent out
orders, and I expected a cool tumbler of water to appear in matters of
seconds, after all the open door and the fridge I could see were only a
few meters away. But the wait continued, and so did my desperation.
About 15 minutes later, one of her young sons hurried back with the
2-litre bottle of Coke and a couple of plastic glasses. They were
filled, and I was offered one. I refused, ‘I don’t drink Coke, and I
really, really do want water, can I please just have some?’. In my
breaking voice, the desperation was evident.

Another nod from Saroj, and this time the water did materialise in
matter of seconds. As I was guzzling the cool water, Saroj remarked,
with a slight amusement in her voice, ‘but people like you, even in the
slums, don’t drink water or eat at our place’. The upper-caste
inscription which my body carries and hard as I try, I cannot scrub it
off, and surely never announce, had led to the anxiousness which it was
reckoned the ultimate metonym of capitalist-consumerist celebration, a
Coke, could resolve. There are more than many such encounters and
instances wherein gender, caste, communal, regional distances and
differences are maintained: people of different caste will not drink or
eat in other’s houses; sometimes they will not enter into each other's
houses, having the entire social interactions at the doorsteps for
years, and certain lanes are avoided on account of certain kinds of
people living in those camps in the slums.

The practices in the immediate, intimate realm, whether be of culinary
preferences and prejudices; the nostalgic continuation of regional
traditions, even if the region (the village) had not been visited in
their living histories; the peculiar sense of fashion, which both
determines the shades of decency but also ‘daring’ (as it is articulated
especially by the youth to challenge the traditional norms); the shifts
in notion of leisure and utilization of time, and the anxieties about it
among other sections in GP, are not merely a manifestation of the
interiority of cultural identities being produced and performed in
public. But, I insist, that in these everyday, ‘banal’, *apolitical*
activities, the political selves of the residents of GP is foregrounded
– inadvertently, unwittingly, and also not without a certain
deliberation – and is at once a response to the material realities of
being a slum-dweller, but also the broader dialectical relationships
within which these are produced.

And thus to return to my own position as an ethnographer, even though
aware of these complexities, I found myself unable to take the bull by
its horns, so to say, to ask the residents of GP, what is your political
position? What informs it? Who do you vote for? What does casting a vote
mean? What sense of entitlements, rights do you expect from the
government you voted in? How do you respond when the candidates, parties
you voted in do not respond to your needs? And in setting these specific
questions as the only ones resolving the overwhelming question (oh, why
do the poor vote?) I was committing a double whammy of a research (and
by extension intellectual and political) faux pas in absenting from the
banal, apolitical, everyday practices of the residents of GP their
political selves.

Whilst it is tempting to attribute naiveté, lack of experience to this
blind spot in discussing with the residents of GP their political selves
and ecologies during the initial research period, the personal
hesitation and unease to discuss these concerns with the slum-dwellers
(as a middle-class, educated, upper-caste individual) is in fact
representative of the broader and fundamental anxiety to engage with the
marginalised, the identified others. In this essay, it is the others in
their political presences and performances that hold the centre-stage.

## But, Why Should We *Not* Vote? 

Between late 2012 and early 2013, following up to the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections, I focused on the manner in which
residents of GP were mobilized by different parties and the role of
local leaders within the slums. As a researcher, I was more confident
and confrontational in my research agendas and questions than my initial
forays into GP.

Amidst the intricate, incestuous and maze-like lanes of GP, the summer
afternoons are like an older relative having a nap, around whom the
children uncontainable enthusiasm have to tip-toe, lest they wake them
and invite their wrath. The winter afternoons, on the contrary, are like
a never-ending blanket that is being woven by the old and young alike,
spread out on the terraces, squat in precious corners where the sun has
not died, collectively adding to its warmth. The winter of 2012 was no
different, except along with the tales and talks of the everyday, the
know-how about the neighbours, and what was happening in another’s
house, the afternoons were enlivened by the announcements by
representatives of different political parties contesting the MCD
elections; meetings to ‘get-to-know’ the candidate; and the speculative
conversations about each candidate’s politics and their proposed
agendas.

As researcher, with a very precise focus to resolve the identified
question, the matter of the different political parties, their
histories, the profile of the respective candidates, the presence in the
slums and their past achievements and interventions in the slums was not
a concern. But the conversations in GP were replete with these
discussions, more specifically targeted towards a character appraisal of
the candidates from different parties. The matter of their personal
fortune; their businesses; love affairs; benevolence; corruption; the
arm-strength each candidate could yield via the *goons* in each of the
camps, among many other facets, were discussed to threadbare
repetitions. From my *then* naive position of reckoning that the
political of the poor is a distinct, separate entity – almost as an
astral form floating over and above - from the *banality* of the
everyday, I found these conversations tiring. But I persisted, perhaps
awaiting a fate like Ali Baba’s to chance upon the magic words, *open
sesame,* to enter into this astral political realm, where ideologies,
revolutions, utopia would be discussed, aspired and designed towards. I
started to suspect everyone of Morgiana’s deftness and cunning to keep
me out.

One of the most common refrains, after a candidate had been reproached
for an action or other, or indeed praised for a redeeming act, was that
after the reverie of the elections, the meetings, the rallies, the
fascination of freebies and the grand promises into the future were
over, and one or the other candidate had won, the jhuggi-walahs will be
left to their fate, to fend for themselves and nothing was going to
change. This sentiment was particularly exaggerated one afternoon in
Baby’s lane.

When the candidate for whom Baby had been appointed to organise a ‘meet
and greet’ gathering did not turn up, instead sending his deputy laden
with samosas and ladoos for the attending women, the disappointment and
resentment was particularly severe.[^4_5] Baby’s sister-in-law, and her
neighbour, have a fraught relationship. Their loud recriminations of
every aspect and each member of other’s lives are commonplace, followed
with much interest by the neighbours for its abusive, obscene and often
simply jocular affects. Since the campaigning for the elections had
started, and Baby had agreed to be an agent for the candidate in
question, Baby and her sister-in-law’s relationship had taken a turn for
the worse. Baby did not leave any opportunity to exhibit and perform her
newly acquired importance as an agent, proximity to the candidate and
lending a suggestive air about herself that she indeed was in the
know-how of what ensues in the inner circles. And thus when the much
deliberated event was a no-show, and Baby publicly shamed, how could the
sister-in-law miss the opportunity to rub salt into the wounds?

The sister-in-law is a garrulous woman of bulbous proportions. When she
is present, she does not only defiantly occupy the space, she indeed
becomes the space. Considering not only Baby, personally, but the
jhuggi-walllahs*,* collectively, had been humiliated by the candidate’s
no-show, the sister-in-law could not hurl a direct assault at Baby,
instead in the manner of the ‘voice, the great deep cry of \[the\] Fog
Horn shuddering through the rags of mist’, pronounced, her heaving,
heavy breasts sans the *dupatta* punctuating her performance, ‘we have
to cast our vote, irrespective of the fact that nothing ever happens.
Our fate is worse than that of the whores. We will have to fuck someone,
someone will fuck us, whether we get anything or not. Well, let’s vote
for Baby’s candidate this time, after all she is one of ours’.[^4_6]

An otherwise unapologetic woman, Baby had shrunk becoming the corner she
was leaning against. Baby was my introduction to this lane in Navjeevan
camp, and I had shared her enthusiasm in getting things in order for the
now no-show ‘meet and greet’ (if only to understand the intricate
workings of political mobilization in the slums). I realised that in
such a pronouncement irrespective of whether the said candidate won or
lost, it would be reckoned Baby’s responsibility for ‘nothing happening’
for the next five years and for its residents to have been yet again
*fucked over. *

I intervened, and with a certain sense of permission that I could. The
strict researcher-researched, self-other boundaries were already
blurring. I put out the overwhelming question, in almost a manner of
reproach to those present for *ganging up* on baby, which I had been yet
been waiting to ask at the opportune moment (perhaps when I had in fact
chanced upon the *political* of the poor), ‘so, why do you vote then?’.

The question drew exclusively attention to me, and a momentary stern
silence was followed by a collective question (Baby had immediately
shifted sides as well) in the manner spoken to the child who had missed
the basics of multiplication: ‘But, why should we *not* vote?’

‘Well’, I continued, sensing that I finally have to tell the others what
they don’t know, all of you keep on insisting that nothing happens,
that the politicians just use you for the vote, they treat you nicely
only during the elections, and after that no development takes places,
and things don’t change, then why do you vote?’. The conversation, now
almost combative continued, ‘but still what has nothing happening, no
improvement, corrupt politicians have to do with why we should not
vote?’

## The Theatre of the Political and the Subaltern as Unrealised Characters

Both Baby’s sister-in-law’s pronouncement, and the following assertion
about casting the vote among the residents of GP, set in motion an
intellectual paralysis and stasis. As if all this time, my engagement
with the poor had been the Rorschach test being read upside down. Of
course, why ought not the poor vote? And when they in fact do, why ought
their choices be put under threadbare examination in regards to their
motivations, awareness and engagement with not only the democratic ideas
but also the working of the systems and processes? In the analyses to
address the overwhelming question – why do the poor vote - the
underlying sentiment is that the unique vibrancy of the Indian
democratic system (though what makes it unique in fundamental,
foundational ways is never really spelled out) and the society’s
inherent pluralistic and accommodative character extends *hope* to the
poor, even though their predicament remains more or less unchanged.

The rationale for the poor’s presence, unrelenting participation and
performance identifies and emotional core responding to the hope
candidate, the party’s rhetoric and theatrical rallies can evoke. On the
other hand, the tendency of the non-poor not to vote, especially at the
most local jurisdictional level of Municipal elections, is accorded to
an informed decision premised on disconnect, apathy and dismay with the
democratic and political systems, processes and their functioning. Of
course, I am presenting a rather simplistic condensation of these
analyses, poignant and pertinent in their significant ways. And the
intent is not to either critique or contribute to these discussions.

The seemingly straightforward question, ‘So, why do you vote then?’,
were the magic words to open and enter the astral realm of political of
the poor I had been desperately seeking for. The question of why, how,
whom and towards what end the poor vote for were all at once rendered
inconsequential if they were not teased out, approached and explored
within the ‘particular conception of the world[^4_7]’ the slum-dwellers,
the poor, those on the margins, inhabit.

The ‘particular conception of world’ the poor, subaltern, marginalised
have, lending them their peculiarity, is not a symptom of their poverty,
marginalisation and subalternity. Instead, poverty itself is the
condition of concrete historical, geographical social, political
processes, grounded in the broader material realities and dialectical
relationships. In order to engage with the political (here, with the
intent to understand why and how the poor vote) of the poor, or for that
matter any facet of their lives which cannot simply be viewed in
isolation, these processes, their historicity – however contemporary –
must be foregrounded to insist on the vulnerability, precarity and
unliviability as these are the axis along with which the bodies of the
poor in their corporeality and their presences in dispersed abstractions
(political, cultural, social) exist.

Without such an undertaking, the subaltern, the poor, the marginalised
(of each and every order, category and constant calibration) shall be
stuck sharing the fate of Pirandello’s unrealised characters.[^4_8] And
thus I abandoned the project of once and for all neatly resolving the
overwhelming question*,* but I also did not assume the role of the
elusive author who would finally allow the subaltern as *characters* to
realise themselves. In short, I became one of the unrealised characters,
whose predicament and politics was not determined by the *condition* of
poverty, but was nevertheless in search of a narrative (and author)
which could allow for an ethical cohabitation with the subalterns, the
poor, and those on the margins.

## Enter the Booth: Politics without the Politics

By late December, 2012, I extensively and intimately started following
the everyday of two women leaders, both affiliated with the right-wing
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Saroj and Saiddya. The two of them made an
unlikely pair. Saroj, who passed away in 2014, was a wiry,
*beedi*-smoking, lower-caste woman. Saiddya hails from a middle-caste,
Muslim family. As flamboyant as Saroj was, uninhibited in making her
presence felt and claiming the space, Saiddya presents herself with a
demure but definite sense of self. The pair of them piqued my interest
as both of them representatives of their constituencies – lower-caste
Hindu and Middle-caste Muslim, respectively – are traditionally reckoned
to face the wrath (the intent of a discipling agenda) of the right-wing
Rashtriya Swamay Sevak (RSS) backed, BJP rhetoric.[^4_9]

In the task assigned to mobilise women to vote for BJP in the upcoming
elections, and as I followed them, there were no speeches, pamphlets to
be distributed, either an excited celebration of BJP’s candidate for
councilour from the area or a hectic criticism of the opposing
candidates. The matters that dealt with were everyday and commonplace.
The difficulties, roadblocks, the families – either visiting or who were
paid a visit - were encountering whilst dealing with the different state
agencies, hospitals, police, legal matters, as also domestic disputes
and the manner in which Saroj and Saiddya’s interventions (owing to
their proximity to the candidate) mitigated these issues.

Of the two Saiddya was the more restraint and demure one; as Saroj would
jocularly comment, ‘of the two us she is the respectable one, that is
why she goes to the schools and hospitals, I am the bloody loudmouth
that is why I have to deal with the goons, sister-fucker of men who beat
up their wives and the cops’.

And indeed Saroj, weighing less 50 Kgs, held her might with aplomb. It
was spending afternoons with her that I had my lessons which refined and
sophisticated my engagement with the politics of the subaltern. She
would command – everything she did, even a smile, gravitas of a command
– space, respect and attention, and indeed got it. And I felt highly
privileged to be taken under her patronage. After wandering about the
lanes, a *charpoy* would be summoned, almost blocking the passage (but
who could dare to complain), Saroj would spread her meagre self on it
and I would be the only one allowed to sit on it next to her. The first
time two glasses, filled to the brim with undiluted, dark rum, were
served to Saroj and I in the afternoon, I was slightly taken aback and
my hesitation was very evident. After the initial performance of
chastity, I used to smoke openly, and share drinks with friends in GP,
but before this had never done publicly.

In her classic style, Saroj slapped her thighs, and laughed, ‘listen, I
know you are like me, we are just the same, I realised this the moment I
saw you. You are very courageous, and you are not a cheat, but you are
definitely not one those ‘nice, virtuous’ ones, so drink up’.

In re-listening to the conversations, recorded during those few months,
whilst drinking rum, smoking, sharing the most intimate aspects of our
lives, deliberating politics, I am at once overwhelmed with gratitude
for the wealth of wisdom, lived experience and insights Saroj shared
with me, and taken by a child-like fancy to click my heels and dance for
her approval of me. In that, this essay is a tribute to Saroj's memory,
the organic intellectual and philosopher par excellence. I learned my
first practical lesson in the possibilities of ethical cohabitation, as
a praxis and practice.

The conversations, long and winding, often without a specific beginning
and usually with an abrupt end, were uninhibited, often confusing and
combative. Whilst my debt to Saroj in my engagement with the political
of the poor is surmount, the voices which guided me through were many
and abounded in their multiplicities. Saroj, here, is evoked as a
medium, a channel, and a mouthpiece of these voices, which all did not
sing in unison, there were conflicts and tensions.

On one of these afternoons, I finally raised Saroj the question which
had been bothering me since I was first introduced to Saiddya and her,
‘we know how BJP talks about the lower-castes, the Muslims (the
demolition of Babri Masjid had been a topic of discussion between us),
then how do the two of you reconcile to being associated with a party
which is so openly anti-Muslims and so upper-caste?’

During these winter afternoons in late 2012- early 2013, I found myself
intensely engaged in the density of the everyday life of the
slum-dwellers, especially the political. In these discussions I had
anticipated an animated discussion about the recently concluded India
Against Corruption[^4_10] (IAC) movement (April 2011-November 2012) which
had led to the emergence of a new political party, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
from within the section of protesting leaders.[^4_11]

‘Did you organise people, especially the women, to go to Jantar
Mantar[^4_12], to take part in the protests against the whole corruption
prevalent in the country?’.In asking this question, I retrospectively
realise my folly to reckon that the *poor* had naturally allied to the
cause; even though in my distant analyses of the movement (from
Singapore) I had presented a highly critical evaluation of it in regards
to the participation of the middle-classes and the framing of corruption
within a cleanliness discourse.

Then Saroj went to explain and implicate herself in the *danda of
gusskori* \[the business of bribing, and thus by that extension being
corrupt\].

In the framing of the corruption as a social malice, the IAC movement
specifically insisted on the role of the people who *give* bribes in
perpetuating corruption, highlighting their immorality in this
complicity. Here, then the voices intervened questioning their own
participation? Is it corrupt to give money to get the child into school?
To get an identity card made? What do they mean by black money*,* for us
money is like magic, it disappears as soon we lay eyes on it, one of the
congregating woman jocularly remarked. Of course, everyone agreed.

With the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections only a few weeks away,
I raised questions not about why they vote in abstraction, but the
grounded practices of it: who they will vote for? Whose campaign seemed
effective? Which candidate? In raising these questions, I was hoping to
arrive at the epistemological, reflexive processes through which
'decisions' are made, and the manner in agency and structure were
negotiated in a Bourdieuian sense.

The responses at the most fundamental level seemed frivolous to me: ‘we
vote because we can’. That was the most common refrain, the much touted
celebration of the practice of the poor voting as exercising their right
was not asserted as vehemently as I had read/expected. Of course, in my
naïveté then I failed to identify the capacity to act (in the action of
casting a vote) in itself an event of assertion of agency. One man, a
first-time voter in the coming elections, announced, ‘I will be voting
for Congress’. *Who is the candidate? ‘*I don't know the candidate, the
family has been voting for Congress ever since, and how can we betray
the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi!’. *I don't understand,* I said. ‘Well,
they are descendants of Mahatma Gandhi, Indira was his daughter’.
*Well,* I interjected, *that wasn't the case. Indira Gandhi was Nehru's
daughter, she was married to a man whose last name was the same as
Gandhi. ‘*She was a Gandhi, right, and of Congress, *hum tho haat ko
denge* \[we will vote for the 'hand', the Congress party's symbol\]’.

‘*Aap kisko vote dete ho?’ (w*hom do vote for?), I was under the
inquisition and scrutiny of those, including Saroj, whose political
motivations I had until then putting under microscopic examination. I
fumbled, I was embarrassed until then (2012) I had not cast my vote in
*any* of the elections in the country – General, State and Municipal. In
fact, I didn't even have a voter's identification to be eligible to cast
the vote. I told them as much. ‘So, you cannot vote. *Yeh tho bahut
chutiyapa hai* \[this is such a bummer\]. Saroj mausi (an aunt –
mother's sister, and as she was referred to by one and all) can get you
made one, you know’. Saroj nodded, and added, ‘no charge for you’. The
*act* of not casting the vote in fact cast a shadow of doubt on my
politics as event, ‘*tho koi party koh support kaise karte ho?’ (*so,
how do you show your support to any party?)’.

Political being the only terrain in and through which I negotiated my
own identity, I feel ambushed. I took on to give a brief history of my
political engagement with the left*,* my involvement with All India
Students Association (student wing of the Communist Party of India
(Marxist–Leninist) Liberation) as student at Jawaharlal Nehru
University, the commitment to the agenda of the left*,* workers
revolutions, instilling revolutionary consciousness, the concerns with
class struggles, against caste and communal tendencies, etc. They gave
me a patient hearing, until Saroj interrupted rather irritably, ‘*Beta,*
this party, whichever it is, seems the one we should be aligning with,
right? They work for us, but pray tell me one thing, why haven't we
heard of them before this? Why haven't any of their representatives come
to us? Where are they?’.

I was silenced in humility. The ‘organic intellectual’ had made a
pronouncement resounding the anxieties of Ranciere's cited earlier. And
thus we returned to the act of voting – not as a metaphor, or the
burdens of its memory – but as an event in an asserting agency.

Yet again, evoking Saroj as the mouthpiece, the loudspeaker, the
channel, the medium, for the multitudinous and multiplicities of the
*voices*,

> Hum vote karte hain, koi ki kar saakte hai \[We vote because we can\].
> A while back you were asking about people selling their votes, and
> even if they have committed to voting for someone, got the money, why
> don't they vote for someone else? Yahan pe kutch maslee hain \[there

A young, pretty lady, a domestic-worker by profession, an attentive
audience to these conversations, one of the afternoons, amused by the
fervour of the discussions, breaking the decorum of interrupting Saroj
(an act which otherwise invited severe reprimand from her, had it not
been for the pretty lady's youthful exuberance and infectious
excitement), ‘When the voter registration comes which also has a photo,
it feels really nice. Taking that slip to the booth is so much fun, and
when I go in I press whichever button fancies me’.

Saroj smiled at her indulgently, and said to her, ‘*Beta*, this time,
when we are going to the booth, you come with us, we will have even more
fun’.

## The Subaltern as Political Voyeur

The discussions about the politics of the poor in Govindpuri in
2012-2013 highlighted the resonances of the India Against Corruption
movement (IAC) of 2011 and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) 201s
amongst its residents. In 2015, I also closely followed the involvement
of the residents with the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections. Each of
these events as they unfolded within the ecology of Govindpuri are
deserving undertakings on their own, and a reading of these three
political moments in conjunctions only lends to further nuanced reading
(and thus revealing) of the ‘organic, political’ selves of its
residents.

The imagined, projected call of a clean, corruption free India did not
hold much resonance here. It was, as discussed through the narratives,
not on account of the idea of corruption, and thus its absences, as
incomprehensible, but the linear and collapsible identification of the
corrupt with immorality, greed and to a far-fetched extent being
anti-national. The fact of everyday lives of living on the margins
compels negotiating with the state, its authorities and the mainstream
through a network of tacit arrangements and exchanges, more often than
not, humiliating and disenfranchising for the poor. Do they want to
continually experience it? If they had a choice, would they still do it,
were the rhetorical questions raised to be answered in the negative. Of
course not. Would they not want services, goods and their rightful
demands to be fulfilled without succumbing to these tactics? Of course
yes. But what to do? Without these corrupt practices, left to their own
devices by the State, they would perish.

In their rejection of the so-reckoned ‘second struggle for freedom’, the
slum-dwellers reveal with an astute sensibility a sociological-political
reality, which a lot of commentators and enthusiast of the movement
sustained an amnesia about in its celebration, that corruption is a
structural and systemic concern, its practices unfolding in the social
realm (caste being its pivotal and obscenest manifestation) is far more
detrimental than the financial exchanges. In fact, the latter relies on
the former to exact and exaggerate its benefits.

In the immediate political ecology of the MCD 2013, elections,
epitomised in the two women, Saidyya and Saroj, the arbiters of
political agendas of the parties within the slums, reveal political
sensibilities, vocabularies and capacities to negotiate the concerns of
caste, gender, amongst others categories, towards a census and/or
conflict. These negotiations are poignantly revealing in more ways than
one: they highlight that the slums, and its residents, are not a
homogenised whole, and that to achieve the desired political end an
*insider* is indeed needed as the ploy of ‘empty’ promises and
incentives is just not enough.

During the celebrations of the Delhi Assembly Elections results on 10
February 2015, the repeated insistence of the party's victory being
theirs and the responsibility to ensure good governance shared by them
with the elected members, the residents of GP at once emphasized the
importance of their participation in AAP's success and claimed ongoing
partnership with the state. Along with these insistences the residents
reiterated that they had exercised this political mandate out of their
own will, and that they had not succumbed to either incentives,
coercions or considerations of identity politics (all implicated in
other political rallies that I have observed) to bring to fruition the
'*andolan',* movement, which AAP as a party had set out to accomplish by
ensuring their sweeping victory in the Delhi elections 2015. In this
political performance, the residents' revealed a highly matured and
assured political self.

And here, I return to the thought with which I started the essay. And to
the misplaced reckoning of the ‘scientist’, the lot of which I am often
associated with and the association I vehemently oppose, that the
dominated do not in fact understand the laws and logic of domination. It
is a matter of deliberation to not allow the task of meaning-making of
the ‘self’ to the subaltern as it then allows to obliterate the ‘self’
of the subaltern in its corporeality, only to be engaged in its
abstractions. As evidenced through the narratives here, the subaltern is
not only aware of the rules of the games of domination but also knows
how to subvert and disrupt it, even though only slightly and, more often
than not without, any substantial impact.

In fact, through the performance of political ‘naivety’ – *what do we
know? What can we do? -* expected of them, the slum-dwellers demonstrate
an astute awareness of the experience of poverty they are expected to
perform, especially when encountering State agents, civil society
workers and politicians, to accrue financial assistance, subsidies and
other benefits. The performance to accrue immediate and extended
‘benefits’ is often confused with their compromised and absent political
core, a reckoning which the grounded experiences of the political of the
poor puncture.

In each of these three events, India Against Corruption 2011, as
*rejection* to the movement's premise*;* the engagement with the MCD
elections 2012, *claiming stakes*; and in the celebration towards the
victory of AAP in Delhi Assembly elections as an event of *political
participation and collaboration,* the slum-dwellers exhibit a highly
mature engagement with the political landscape of the present in its
imagined, immediate and extended ecologies.

Even though these three events highlight the ‘organic, political’ self
of the slum-dwellers, as a representative constituency of the subaltern,
the tapestry of being and becoming it unfolds within is revealing of a
finer, intricately woven, sometimes fragile, designs. The slum-dweller,
she, is at once astute and street-smart; she knows what she wants, but
sometimes is lead ashtray; she gives in to her desires with a reckless
ferocity, but she also holds on to her grounds, when she wants, putting
at stake her most intense desires and immediate needs. If she knows the
lanes of the slums, reckoned dreaded and dark by those who have never
ventured into, like a sorcerer, she is not lacking in the knowledge,
desire and imagination of the highways and super-highways out there. In
short, she is an argumentative, intuitive, emotional, not without the
intent of self-interest, inquisitive, imaginative, deliberative whole.

Poverty is a compelling and difficult text to read, and its committed
readers few and far between. In engaging with the politics of the poor,
it is easier to reckon, identify the political as existing in isolation,
a seductive temptation so as not to concern oneself with the messiness
of the processes, structures, systems which produce and systematically
sustain poverty. Moreover, in engaging with the political of the poor,
detached from their diverse sensibilities and sentimentalities, it
becomes convenient and commonplace to expect the commitment of the poor
to the predicament of poverty to violent, loyalties; such that, the poor
then can be (and are allowed) only to be poor, devoid of emotions,
aspirations and desires. However: Poverty does not happen in isolation,
and nor does politics and poetics. The subaltern knows, lives and
experiences it well.

The State and the hegemonic narratives, deliberately deny the poor the
capacity to imagine, inquire and emote. And if it is in fact extended to
them, it is only within the terms of excesses, threatening to tear the
seams of the social fabric. And in this identification, as definite
structural and systemic tactics, the poor, the marginalised, the
disenfranchised, the subaltern, is recognised as an ‘imbecile’, lacking
a core, logic and sense of ‘self’. The plans and policies that are thus
envisaged for this constituency not only absent their presences – as
they do not know they are present – but are always predicated on the
project of disciplining them towards an evolutionary agenda of
incorporating them into the normative social, cultural, political order.

And it is within this schematic that I evoke the imagery of the
subaltern as a 'voyeur', seeking intellectual, theoretical and real
permissions for the subaltern to be voyeuristic. The State engages with
the subaltern as *voyeur* in its aimless and senseless wanderings, which
it then translates as necessitating the agenda of containing, silencing
and disciplining the subaltern. However, the subaltern as a *voyeur* in
its second avatar is possessed of imaginations, inquisitions and
emotions to draw out its own maps, where its coordinates are steadfastly
located (and thus allowing it capacities to shift back, forth and
sideways), and these mappings are populated with many of its selves,
spaces, and histories.

Thus, in celebrating the voyeurism *of the subaltern*, the intent is to
recognise and engage with the ‘organic, political’ self of the
subaltern, with all the misconceptions, misgivings and multiplicities
she possesses. This is not merely an ambitious, well-intentioned,
romantic agenda; without allowing for the imaginations, inquisitions and
emotions of the subaltern, the project of the realisation of a truly
democratic, ethical, equitable and just social, cultural and political
order remains and shall so, a distant dream.
