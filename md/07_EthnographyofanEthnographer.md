# 1. In Search of the Never-lost Slums: Ethnography of an Ethnographer 

*Hear this: clanking of utensils; water filling plastic bottles; tender
bottoms being slapped; grown-up cheeks struck; raucous laughter in the
corners; coins being sorted; technologies of communication,
communicating—phones, televisions and amplifiers, creating, collapsing
and distancing words and lives; sellers of wares, necessary, unrequired,
and varied, dangling their goods through the prowess of their throats;
children otherwise told to ‘shut up’ in the classrooms frolicking about
imitating the tongues elders speak—I will fuck your sister, you are a
cunt; the elders making claims to the fucking—of mothers, sisters,
daughters—with more intent and lost innocence; aazaan on the loudspeaker
from the mosque in the corner defining the day for many; the same
loudspeaker announcing the find of a young Hindu boy, who if not claimed
timely enough will be converted; the precious touch of the hand to the
bells in the temples nearby, ting-tong, tong-tong, tinging; the hum of
the city passing by; the vehicular conversations, honkingly undertaken;
confidences of the most delicate sorts shared across corridors, lanes,
and lives; songs of yearning penetrating through; a young girl on the
roof remembering the cities she is forbidden to visit; an old man
spinning yarn of the lives he has not lived to everyone in general and
no one in particular.*

## The Interrogation

It was a Delhi summer afternoon on its deathbed. The evening promised
the colours, but not respite from the heat. I was walking along the main
road (Baba FatehSingh Marg) which separates Nehru Camp from the legal
lanes, 15 in all, of Govindpuri. The distance to Nehru Place, the site
of my first unwitting ethnographic research, was only a matter of a
couple of kilometers but I could not wait to get there fast enough. The
long-delayed, and now much-desired, smoke and a glass of cold beer felt
like a deserving indulgence after the hours I had spent in Nehru camp.

Here, I had spent the last few hours interviewing residents of this
camp, mostly women, about their everyday. Perhaps interviewing is
misleading as it suggests an engaged, informed inquisition on my part. I
had in fact spent these hours merely hurdled in a corner, of whomsoever
was generous enough to allow me that space, listening to them live their
everyday. Even with little or nothing to contribute to these
conversations, I felt a day’s work well done.

At a few meters distance from the main road, from where I meant to hail
an auto, I was stopped by a doctor with whom I had casual acquaintance
and who ran a little clinic from a *jhuggi* in Nehru camp. He invited me
to his clinic for a conversation which I found difficult to decline.
After all, I reckoned, it was important for me to establish as many
contact points in the slums as possible. I had never been inside his
clinic. The *jhuggi* coupling as a clinic was only different from the
others I spent time in with its lack of an overwhelming bed, a
refrigerator in the corner and a precariously perched television set.
The presence of a not-so-white coat, a stethoscope and an array of
unmarked bottles with little pills extended respectability to his
self-proclaimed profession. There was nothing (by the way of framed
certificates) or no one (in the form of ailing patients) to corroborate
his claims. But he nevertheless proceeded in a precise and clinical
manner to inquire about my reasons for spending time in the slums.

‘I am doing my doctoral research, I am interested in understanding how
the poor live’, I muttered almost as an apology, slightly taken aback by
not knowing the answer myself in its entirety’.

The doctor, unfazed by discomfort, continued with his prognosis:

> You do not have to come here everyday to know about that. I can tell
> you all there is to know about the poor, these slum people, the
> jhuggi-wallahs. People like you come here every once so often, for a
> few months, and think you know it all about the poor, how they are
> suffering, how miserable they are, what small houses they have, no
> jobs, and wonder what to do about them, right? But you are mistaken,
> these people – the jhuggi-wallahs – are the scum of the earth. They
> are all pretending. Of course I am not one of them, I am only here to
> help them, but are they interested, no, they are not. They have become
> used to doing nothing, and living off charities, making a fool of
> people like you. You think you come here, they are nice to you, do not
> be fooled. Come here in the evening, the same people – these men –
> saying madam, madam, to you will not think twice about ripping your
> clothes, mounting you violently, raping you collectively, laughing at
> you all the while and leaving you to rot on the corner of the road.

When I came to the main-road again, the evening was firmly set but I was
bereft of a sense of accomplishment and assuredness of a while back. The
doctor’s violent sermonising about my fate at the hands of the
jhuggi-wallahs had left me rattled. I abandoned the collected composure,
which became of me during my visits to the camps, frantically hailed an
auto and hurried towards the intoxicants, no longer as an award but as a
refuge.

In short, I was scared were such a fate in fact to befall upon me; after
all, what did I know about ‘*these jhuggi-wallahs’*? Doesn’t everyone
speak of ‘them’ as being morally and otherwise corrupt, violent and
decadent? Why ought I be spared? I found myself overwhelmed,
emotionally, but also in the same instance intellectually and
politically compromised. After all, in the comfortable confines of one
living-room or another, and ensconced within the walls of JawaharLal
Nehru University, the bastion of left-leaning politics and teaching, had
I not proclaimed about the rights, and denial of dignity, to the poor,
marginalised and disenfranchised? Had I not patronisingly chided at
those who expressed their reservations about these others?

Now, almost 15 years later, I not only claim an intimate relationship
with the people and corners in the slums of Govindpuri, I am also
actively invested in its politics, culture and the everyday. However, I
would not only be compromising truth but also allowing myself undeserved
due if I presented this intimate proximity in and with the spaces of
Govindpuri to have come to me naturally. The first encounter with the
slums of Govindpuri, nothing less than a ‘touristic’ adventure, was a
recce of sorts, to finalise a site of study for a research project.

## A Pervert’s Guide to Slumming

In 2004, I was appointed as researcher assistant to Dr. Jo Tacchi for a
project ethnographically exploring the role of information communication
technologies in poverty alleviation in two sites in India, one rural and
an urban. The slums of Govindpuri were decided upon as the urban site.
The decision was not arrived at on account of the existing, or
potential, networks in the slums but solely on the promise of the
assured, obvious poverty levels in the slums derived from an extensive
secondary research about the state of the slums in the city. Having
arrived at the decision, I asked my then partner, B., whose office was
in the neighbouring middle-class settlement of Kalkaji, to take Dr.
Tacchi and I for a recce of the area before we set out for our fieldwork
the following day. B., a straight-sorta’-fella, was not much amused by
the prospect of I visiting the slums every day, or at least as
frequently, for the next 18 months. His knowledge of the slums at that
time was as academic as mine, but I only recall his anxiety. He complied
with our wishes, driving us around the slums of Govindpuri, all the time
recounting incidents amounting to cautionary tales about taking the
proposed undertaking. Dr. Tacchi and I were amused, but determined.

As a final, desperate, bid to make us change our minds, B. proposed that
if we indeed were so adamant on selecting a slum as our research site,
there was one right next to his office. He added, almost as an
incentive, that way, him and I could get to work together, everyday. The
offer demanded an evaluation, and we agreed to give his slums a chance,
which were basically four makeshift shanties for workers in a nearby
private construction site. The firm silence that occupied the car
informed B. of our decision. Over the years, in lighter moments, I took
to recounting this incident with all its sassy details, B.’s anxiety,
his feeble attempts to keep me away from the slums and offering one of
his own to insist on his apathy, trite middle-class-ness and for being a
straight-sorta’-fella. After all, I would always add as a dramatic
climax, B.’s slums were a few thatched huts by the side of the road,
they were a rather insipid offering compared to the squalid, spectacular
poverty on display of the slums of Govindpuri. It never failed to evoke
uncomfortable laughter.

With this personal narrative, the intent is no longer to embarrass my
then partner B., but to admit to my own anxiety in establishing terms of
engagement with slums as a concept and the reality of the slums of
Govindpuri, in particular, which has dominated my research, political
and intellectual undertakings. By adopting the tactics of deflection, I
shifted the onus of the anxiety on to B.’s, indeed a cheap attempt to
distract attention from mine. But I was the one who visited the slums of
Govindpuri, a few times a week during the period of the research
project, and the knot in my stomach, so to say, to make sense of moving
across the materialities of the slums back to my middle-class confines
left me distressed.

The encounter with the doctor, I started with, not only exaggerated the
sense of anxiousness but also compelled a methodological, intellectual
and political catharsis. If I were to be so fearful of the other, so
much so to dread my safety and violation, how could I ever argue for an
equitable, ethical cohabitational space (politically, intellectually and
culturally) with and for the others – not only slum-dwellers, but also
individuals and communities situated on the praxis on account of their
caste, communal, sexuality and gender affiliations? I was left
distraught. A paralysis of sorts overwhelmed me, I knew I had to revisit
my own prejudices, position and politics. I took a sabbatical from the
field to identify the core from where these anxieties were emanating
from and in what ways to resolve the same, agreeing that if I could not
arrive at an identification or a resolution, I will abandon the project
in the slums and instead take the research to more known, comfortable
settings.

## From the Academic to the Lived: De-coding Slumming

‘*What is it that you really want to know*?’ was a refrain which I had
to constantly negotiate during my initial research engagements within
the Govindpuri slums. I had approached the slums, hesitantly, in early
2004 as a potential research space for a project I was involved in. Till
then, my experience and exposure of the slums in Delhi was through a
primarily middle-class, educated, urbane lens which essentially meant
that whilst I was aware of the violence and rhetoric of displacement and
resettlement vis-à-vis the slums in popular mainstream media and
academic discourse, I had never experienced the space first hand. I had
no understanding of the dynamics of the space about which I had attended
more than a few illustrious talks and conferences.

Over the years, I had helps coming into my house to accomplish the
assigned tasks from different slums depending on which part of the city
I was residing in at that moment. During my conversations with the
helps, I rarely could locate the geographies of the spaces they
inhabited. Occasionally, I would try to follow the maps that were being
unfolded for my benefit. I would, however, always lose my way somewhere
in between hopelessly convincing myself that nothing was lost as ‘*there
wasn’t much difference from one such place (slum) to another’*. All
slums in Delhi, for me, were a homogenized space living the rhetoric of
displacement and resettlement. In my acquired knowledge of the same,
there was no scope for a multitude of experiences and dimensions or,
narratives beyond those of lacking and longing. My initial engagements,
then, were burdened by the guilt of middle-class upbringing which I
naively assumed offered choices denied to the others out of this realm.

The constant refrain, *what is that you really want to know,* with
shifting emphasis, depending on what I was being interrogated about by
whom - my intent, my identity, my personal situation - significantly
contributed towards my education of the spaces and lives of and within
the slums. In the initial years, my middle-class positionality framed
the engagements with the participants. More than the middle-class
identity, and what it represented, it was the agenda of my proposed
research which was constantly questioned and scrutinized. From whatever
little I knew of conducting research in marginal spaces - from personal
accounts of researchers, academic, and other texts - I was not prepared
for such an interrogation. In these texts and accounts, what was
presented was a clean, linear, one-sided engagement with the residents
of marginal spaces, wherein the researcher in question rarely, almost
never, recounts the questions that were asked of her. And thus over the
years, in negotiating the refrain, the roles of the subjects and the
ethnographer were constantly challenged and, more often than not,
reversed.

## The Politics of Poverty Performance

Years after the relationship with the residents of the slums, across
the three camps, had moved beyond the strict researcher-researched
equation, one afternoon, I was sitting in one of the lanes, a few women
and I were catching up with what was happening in our respective lives.
I had recently returned after a longish stint in Australia in mid-2014,
and there was much to update the friends with, including but not limited
to an intense breakup. The women were regaling me with their on-goings:
gossip about new and broken relationships; travels; debts; judicious
loans and the manner in which they were paid; the gold which was bought,
and that against which loans had been secured. All the while tea, snacks
and smokes were being shared with a generous amount of teasing, laughs
and occasional reprimands.

Our reverie was interrupted by a group of earnest young girls. They were
huddled together, and their hesitance was obvious. They introduced
themselves as students of the Delhi School of Social Work and informed
us that they were conducting a survey about the living conditions in the
slums. The gathered women, almost in chorus, spoke about the
difficulties of living in the slums; the lack of water; the deplorable
sanitation facilities and so on so forth. As they left, after a while we
all burst into a cackle of being on in a shared joke. Though nothing was
evidently said, it was obvious that the women (and with them, I) were
revelling in the performance just brilliantly pulled off. The
performance in question is in tune with the mandate informing the agenda
and the praxis of engagements, inadvertently, subtly and insidiously, of
most researchers, activists, non-governmental and governmental agents
visiting spaces as the slums: *the poor can only perform and live in
poverty.*

Slums as spaces, witness interventions from agencies, organizations, and
individuals assuming the role of interrogators. These interventions are
on account of varying agendas: state initiatives to conduct surveys,
activities facilitated by social groups operational in the area catering
to specific needs (health, sanitation, education, among other), and
academic-social research. My interactions with the space and its
residents fall in the last category. In the last three-decades of the
settlements’ existence, the Govindpuri *slums* have continually
experienced encounters with different and diverse researchers, agents
and agencies. The residents are acutely aware of the benefits these
encounters accrue for them, whether these be in regards to being
enrolled in governmental records, which attracts subsidies in different
forms, or being beneficiaries of different non-governmental schemes. And
at once, as is evidenced from the performance of poverty in the
aforementioned incident, the residents are astutely cognizant of the
fact that the interrogators only want to hear narratives and experiences
of lacks, poverty and *being poor*.

In 2005, during one of my trips in Navjeevan camp, I was walking around
with a group of young adults from the local school which is run by a
prominent NGO in Delhi. There was no fixed agenda for interviews or
group discussions and we were wandering around the camps, recording
conversations and discussions, and clicking pictures. In one of the
streets, the students initiated a conversation with an old woman who was
sewing clothes for an export house. The students were interested in the
patterns she was sewing and a discussion about the volume of her
assignments per week, how she finishes it, and the remuneration for it,
followed. Around this time, two old men joined the discussion. They were
not actively participating in the discussion but would occasionally make
a comment. Interpreting this as their willingness to join the
discussions, I asked one of the men, directly, a question about the
penetration of small-scale industrial units in the camps and its
benefits to the residents when he suddenly burst out into an angry
retort. He accused me of being an agent of the NGO, which supported the
school, to perpetuate its agenda:

> They \[the NGO\] are only interested in showcasing poverty so they can
> get funds from the big companies from abroad. They are not bothered
> about us. What do you know about us? They want more and more people in
> the camps to become dependent on them so that they can have us as
> figures in their files \[…\] What do you know about poverty, anyway?.

Not prepared for such a retort, I conveyed to him that I was not
affiliated with the specific NGO in question or any such organization
for that matter. On hearing this, he calmed down commenting that, ‘he
was tired of people coming and asking the same questions over and over
again \[…\] how poor are you? How do you manage, etc.?’ The two men
agreed that it was a humiliating experience for them, their space and
other residents, to be put through such an interrogation, over and over
again, just to avail a few benefits (and sometimes not even that) in
return.

Undertaking research in spaces such as the slums is a politically and
ethnographically messy affair. In the initial couple of years of my
research inroads in the slums of Govindpuri - hesitant, anxious, unsure
of the vocabularies and the grammar of the everyday in the slums - I was
doing my own kind of performance. Usually adorning only jeans and
t-shirts in my everyday and professional spaces, I promptly visited one
of those swanky stores catering to expats and bought two pairs of
*salwar-kameez* and a few scarves. This is one of the most common attire
for young women in the country, and is considered to be a modest wear
compared to the more ‘Western and attention-drawing’ jeans and skirts. A
heavy smoker I would not light up whilst in the slums, and in spite of
being a drinker of some merit, a fact which I would otherwise proudly
claim, even if not asked, I would maintain a stern silence about it. I
also at times found myself blatantly lying, particularly when questions
regarding my romantic status or the income levels were asked of me.

The encounter with the doctor, with which I opened the essay, and the
subsequent sabbatical from the field I took were pivotal in me
sophisticating my own practice and politics of undertaking ethnographic
research (not only in the slums of Govindpuri, but also in any other
site the assignment took me to) and in my endeavours of ‘working the
hyphen’.

## Negotiating the Anxiety of Researching Anxious Spaces

Before undertaking ethnographic research in Govindpuri, I had conducted
a yearlong research in Nehru Place, South Asia’s largest second hand
electronic hardware market and the hub for software piracy. Owing to the
nature of male dominated trade practices in Nehru Place, electronic
retail, repair, and piracy, the space has a very masculine character.
Whilst conducting research in Nehru Place, I had to negotiate the
masculinity of the space. The shops were I usually interviewed people
were amidst narrow lanes and the shops themselves congested places
populated predominantly by men. My presence would demand that the
shopkeepers make unhindered space for me, which more often than not was
disruptive to their activities. However, after the initial hesitation,
the interactions were devoid of the gender politics as for most part, I
was also a potential customer. In addition, the conversations, more
often than not, were around trade practices. Once the trust was
established, most men freely engaged in detailed discussions even those
of illicit nature, particularly since we were discussing the value
supply chains of pirated software, which is a criminal offence. During
this period, I had also established a relationship of mutual exchange
wherein I would bring them CD’s of the latest Open Source software
whilst they offered substantial discounts on the purchases I made. The
nature of the interviews and interactions in Nehru Place did not by any
means challenge or threaten the position of the men, socially and
culturally.

The ethnographic engagements in the Govindpuri slums, on the other hand,
plunged me into the politics of space and its everyday from the very
start. The site of my research had changed from a neutral market place
complex domestic space with multiple political, social, and cultural
complications and prejudices. Unlike the space and scope of engagement
in Nehru Place where the interactions where transactional in nature and
did not involve pursuing sensitive discussions about social, cultural,
political and emotional opinions and conflicts; in the Govindpuri slums
it was precisely in and around these issues that the research was
framed.

In retrospect, I realized that my research engagements in the two
spaces, Nehru Place and Govindpuri slums, differed because of the manner
in which I approached these spaces through the prism of what my
middle-class identity represented. The uncomfortable edginess I could
not resolve in the slums was not because the space was volatile or the
residents hostile. In my initial engagement with the Govindpuri slums, I
realized, much to my dismay, that I was relying too heavily on the
constructions of the slum-dwellers perpetuated by the narratives in
academic discourses, popular media, and everyday middle-class dialogues.
In doing so, I was unconsciously, romanticizing the slum-dwellers by
engaging with them only through the prism of lacking and poverty. In
addition, even though subtly, I was convinced that the slum-dweller
would not be able to understand my middle-class status, background,
identity and its realities.

In short, I realized, I was denying them the capacity to engage and
understand any other reality than their own. In my framing, I was
approaching them as the other.

## Encountering the Self of the Other

Gulabo is a widow who lives in Nehru camp with her 13-year-old son. I
first met her in 2003 whilst conducting research for the Department For
International Development, UK Government, on the ‘Role of ICT’s in
Poverty Alleviation’. The agenda of the project was such that I had to
inquire, at length, about the income, expenditure, and consumption
patterns of each household at length. Such inquisitions are very common
in the Govindpuri slums, undertaken at the beset of either state
agencies or other non-governmental organizations and, more often than
not, have promise of some direct benefit (loans, subsidies, etc.)
associated with them. Whilst conducting the research, my intent of
collecting data of this nature was constantly questioned. Not
surprisingly, considering the precarious relationship the slum-dwellers
have with the state, there is an apprehension vis-à-vis the state
interventions. Though I would constantly reiterate that the data I was
collecting was for purely academic purposes, there would be persistent
requests for extending some kind of help, mostly monetary, to the
families.

During the DFID research, Gulabo as a research participant offered
significant insights in the gender politics and its direct association
with income-expenditure patterns in the Govindpuri camps. She lives in a
two room, very meticulously decorated house. Her house is part of what
initially was one large slums. The initial settlers, over the years,
sold out parts of it to two other families to meet their financial
needs. When I initiated my research in Govindpuri, three families,
including Gulabo’s, formed this cluster. The entry to all the three
houses is common and owing to the lack of space the interactions between
the families at an everyday level is very intense and intimate. During
the conversations, Gulabo always evoked her widowed status and, more
often than not, analyzed situations, income-expenditure patterns, her
everyday interactions, through this prism. Her narrative was shrouded
with the difficulties she had to endure being married to an alcoholic
and the subsequent struggles when he passed away. Though her living
conditions appeared to be comfortable and she was getting her son
educated in a private English medium school, a rarity on account of the
financial burden the family has to bear, she always denied having any
regular income and evaded questions about her financial support systems.
A few months in the year, she set up a roadside kiosk to sell home
cooked eateries in the area. Besides that, she never mentioned having
any other source of income. It was a chance encounter which revealed to
me the complexity of the gender politics and the networks of financial
systems in the slums.

One afternoon at the clinic which I mentioned at the beginning of the
essay, and before the encounter with the practitioner, Gulabo came into
the clinic. She did not immediately register my presence. The medical
practitioner and she were discussing some rent arrangement and
subsequently, the medical practitioner handed some money over to her.
Interested in this transaction, I inquired about its details. Gulabo,
realizing my presence, tried to evade the topic. However, the medical
practitioner mentioned that he has to pay Gulabo a monthly rent for
using this space. Gulabo had never mentioned that she owned any other
property in the slums except the house she lived in. Sensing her
discomfort, I did not pursue the matter further. After that day, Gulabo
would be very reticent in my company. In another incident of a similar
kind, I went to Maya’s (her neighbor and initial owner of the entire
cluster) house during a hot Delhi-summer afternoon. During these times,
the heat is so oppressive that most people withdraw into their houses,
especially when the power situation permits running water coolers. By
this time, it had already been a year since I had been visiting these
families and I had established a relationship outside of the strict
researcher-researched praxis. Maya, her daughter-in-law, and I were
sharing lunch when we heard some men call out for Gulabo. The spatial
layout of the cluster is such that all conversations, if not carefully
contained, can be overheard. We could hear a transaction in negotiation.
The men wanted to purchase some liquor bottles and Gulabo was quoting a
price for the same. Overhearing this conversation in Maya and her
daughter-in-law’s presence was disconcerting. In the last year, Gulabo
or any of her neighbours had not even hinted at Gulabo being involved in
the illicit liquor trading business. Maya, who usually withheld any
comments about Gulabo said:

> \[…\] we know she does it. We don’t approve it. My late husband was
> strongly against it as such activities invite all kinds of people at
> different hours. But, well, she is all by herself. She does not have
> anyone to look after her. Her husband was an alcoholic. He always beat
> her up. Her in-laws constantly tried to appropriate whatever little
> she has.

Over the next few years, I maintained my research and personal
relationship with Maya’s, Gulabo’s, and Shishir’s (the third family in
the cluster); however we never discussed Gulabo’s networks and systems
of generating income. By then, once every so often, she would hinted
that she has sources of income which she cannot disclose and respecting
her desires, I never pursued the inquisitions. Gulabo’s is an extreme
case in point. There were many instances in the Govindpuri camps where
individuals and families did not offer information about their
income-expenditure patterns and I, sometimes, discovered some unrevealed
sources or networks, accidentally. This was on many accounts. On some
occasions, the individuals being interviewed did not have knowledge,
especially women in the households. Besides these, there is a prevalent
threat of being brought under scrutiny by state agencies if involvement
in the networks other that the legitimate ones was offered. Lastly,
these threat perceptions were heightened by my own middle-class
identity. My position was constantly under scrutiny vacillating between
being a state agent to representing a non-governmental charitable
organization with the potential of extending substantial help.

Zameela, an employee at a prominent NGO operating in the Govindpuri
camps, was an important cultural translator whilst also getting me
introductions to diverse groups of people in the camps. One of her
assignments is to facilitate community micro-finance activities. She
primarily works with women groups assisting them in setting and running
Self Help Groups (SHG’s). Whilst visiting the groups with her, I
realized that in spite of my presence, both the men and the women would
freely discussed the income-expenditure patterns divulging in detail the
nodes, networks, and systems in which they had either invested or in
which their savings circulated. After many such meetings, one day I had
the following conversation with Zameela to understand the manner in
which ‘money’ and poverty levels were articulated:

> Tripta \[T\]: When we go together, the residents do not hesitate to
> discuss, even in front of me, the details of their investment, etc.?
> Why is that?
>
> Zameela \[Z\]: What do you mean? When do they say, when you ask them
> about it?
>
> T: They do not lie. I am not saying that. I am just saying they do not
> discuss it as openly. However, when I am with you, they do not
> hesitate but also ask for your advice.
>
> Z: Have you ever been asked how much money you earn in a month?
>
> T: Yes.
>
> Z: And, do you always tell me the exact amount? Or about the savings
> you have? Or the gifts you receive from your parents, etc.?
>
> T: No \[…\] I usually avert the question.
>
> Z: It’s the same thing only a bit more difficult for people in the
> slums. After all these years, they know that the representatives who
> come (either state agents or NGO’s) want to hear that they are poor.
> If they do not find enough indications of poverty, the general
> sentiment is that the victimization will increase and, also, the
> benefits to be derived in terms of loans and subsidies cut down. When
> they discuss the finances with me openly even in front of you that is

> one of them.

Gulabo, I realized, could not discuss the finances with me at length not
because she wanted to hide anything but because there were only that
many vocabularies available to her to discuss these matters with the
outsiders. She was expected within the constructions through which the
slum-dwellers are approached to constantly evoke the narrative of
widowhood, lack of income and fragile social support to garner support
and help from different agencies. The financial systems in the
Govindpuri camps cannot be evaluated through the strict prism of income
and expenditure; multiple nodes and networks at formal, informal,
illicit and interpersonal levels are involved. The navigation through
these networks to optimize them is very significantly dependent on the
social, political, cultural, and moral agency the individual, family, or
group can exercise within this space. Gulabo’s status as a widow, within
the Govindpuri camps, allowed her concessions to engage in illicit
liquor trade, an engagement socially denied to women. However, the same
status and her involvements made her highly vulnerable when negotiating
with the outside agencies, namely, the police.

Once I was visiting a research participant’s house not because an
interview was scheduled but because I needed to take a break from the
research. During visits as such, the conversations were not strictly
research driven and, more often than not, I would be asked to give
updates about my own life, marriage, holidays, etc. Shortly after my
arrival, a few of the research participant’s relatives from the village
paid a visit to her. The research participant introduced me as a friend
who was working in the Govindpuri camps. Tea and snacks were organized.
The conversations that followed amongst them were pertaining to a family
wanting to purchase a newborn baby from someone the research participant
knew. The rates were being negotiated. Soon, the relatives left. The
research participant had sensed my discomfort whilst the conversation
was taking place:

> Research Participant \[RP\]: Did it disturb you? Haven’t you ever
> heard of babies being sold?
>
> Tripta \[T\]: I have but I have only read about it. It has never been
> discussed in front of me. Can’t I do anything about it?
>
> RP: Like what? Stop the sale of the babies? Why?
>
> T: Well, it just does not seem the right thing to be able to sell and
> buy babies like this.

I did not have enough arguments. My middle-class, educated sensibilities
were demanding me to undertake an action. However, at the same time, I
had mixed feelings. I was aware that I could not ignore the matter
whilst at the same time I knew I could not report it. I told the
research participant that I would have a conversation about these
practices with a social activist working with women in the area. Not
with the intent that those involved in this practice, especially the
women, are brought under scrutiny but so that they can be informed about
proper channels and options if they did not want to go through with the
deal. The research participant gave her consent to approach the social
activist. When I asked her whether I could use our conversation as part
of my thesis, she only relented after I assured that in the narrative, I
would not mention any names, locations within the Govindpuri camps, or
communities involved.

As an ethnographer, from a space outside of the one being researched, I
realized, that certain cultures and practices, however dehumanizing they
might appear, need to be situated within the larger matrix of the
materiality of the space. Being a widow in a slum settlement allowed
Gulabo to sustain her livelihood through illicit liquor trade. These
networks would have been very difficult for her to penetrate, if not
entirely accessible, if she were living in a legalized colony. Most of
her clients are from the neighboring lower-middle class legalized
settlement which allows her to bargain the price for the liquor. It is
the networks which the slums allow, owing to their illegal nature, to
flourish that trade practice around sale of new-born babies can be
undertaken.

## Working the Hyphen[^1_1]

Unlike many of the ethnographic studies in different anthropological
traditions which romanticize the subjects and sites, Jorge Luis Borges,
anything but an anthropologist, in The Ethnographer romanticizes, and in
the process complicates, the position of the ethnographer. The
protagonist who had ‘nothing singular about him’ sets out to learn the
‘esoteric rites of the west’ on the persuasion of his college professor
who convinces him that ‘when he came back he would have his
dissertation, and the university authority would see that it was
published’. The protagonist spends two years on the prairie, learns to
unlearn his urban-research ways and is eventually told the tribe’s
secret doctrine. However, on his return, he refuses to reveal the secret
forgoing the promising career he could chance upon by the revelation. He
explains this to his rather indignant professor by stating ‘\[…\] the
secret is not as important as the paths that led me to it. Each person
had to walk those paths himself’. He, Borges informs us to end the tale,
is now ‘married, divorced, and is now one of the librarians at
Yale’.[^1_2]

This brief text, The Ethnographer, played a pivotal role in initiating a
self-reflexive exercise in evaluating my own position as an ethnographer
in different contexts. At different times in varying context, I have
been humbled and equally perplexed by the insights, political, cultural,
and personal, which the subjects have offered without malice or agenda.
I have in the same vein as the protagonist of Borges’s text had several
moments of crisis during my research. The boundaries between what was
purely research material and secrets revealed to me for I had ‘walked
the paths’ were very fluid and blurred. I have often contemplated over
categorizing interactions as interviews, discussions, data, and
conversations of personal nature. Moreover, through these different
categories of interactions evaluate my own shifting position as an
ethnographer or an unwelcome intruder. More often than not, these
categories collapse.

After a research sabbatical and evolving my own frameworks of
participation in the research space, I made new entries into the space
acknowledging that the everyday reality of the slums would never
fundamentally constitute part of my every day and vice versa. This,
however, did not mean that either the slum-dwellers or I could not
evolve dialogic praxis within which we could attempt to understand,
respect, and appreciate the realities we represented and lived. However,
the important breakthrough in the research praxis was to acknowledge,
and critically engage with the subtleties of representations, which I as
an ethnographer or the slum-dwellers as subjects, constantly evoked and
employed to establish certain inroads (including, but not limited to,
research data) for me or derive benefits for the residents of the slums.

As a middle-class ethnographer, my position was uncertain. The
production of knowledge of and about the space, given these constraints,
could not have achieved at by establishing an economy of trust. The
trust, I speak of here is not limited to revealing their lives or the
secrets as was the concern for Borges’s protagonist but also involves
extending respect for the matter of choice for the lives the residents I
was interacting with led. It also meant allowing me to be interrogated
without any apprehensions. This trust is established over a period of
time, when both the parties involved have tested and tried the limits of
the other. Once this trust was established with individuals, families,
and communities in the Govindpuri camps, it also meant that I, as an
ethnographer, had to not question and be judgmental about certain
practices which were prevalent in the Govindpuri camps.

Here, I want to involve and engage the position, articulated and
projected, of the ethnographer as an important element of the
ethnography itself. The experience of the ethnographer cannot be
distanced from the ethnography that emerges for the ethnographer
negotiates, questions, imbibes, and treats preferentially, consciously
or unconsciously, covertly, overtly, and subtly, certain categories of
experiences than others. The ethnographer is not a neutral agency of
observation. Or articulation. And in presenting these, the aim is to
initiate a dialogue on the creation, sustenance, projection, and the
articulation of the other. The importance of contextualizing the
position of the ethnographer is accentuated in the context of the
present study as it located in the slums where the everyday is
constantly examined, articulated, and represented through different
categories of other.

Ethnography as a methodological tool is not devoid of its politics.
George E. Marcus and Michael M. J. Fischer address the problematic and
politics of ethnographic practice within the larger anthropological body
of work in *Anthropology as Cultural Critique: An Experimental Moment in
The Human Science*. Enumerating on the role of an ethnographer in
producing cultural texts, they state:

> In fact, what gives the ethnographer authority and the text a
> pervasive sense of concrete reality is the writer’s claim to represent
> a world as only one who has known it firsthand can, which thus forges
> an intimate link between ethnographic writing and fieldwork.[^1_3]

It is *this* authority, which is vested in an ethnographer, in me,
through the methodological tool one employs that one needs to constantly
not only be conscious about but also question it constructively. And I
was consciously aware of this predicament. The ethnographer, in essence,
should acknowledge the implications of the authoritative engagement and
representation with a researched space. As an ethnographer working in
the slums, I entered into the space as an outsider as I am not a
resident of the space. I have not lived the space. That, however, does
not mean that I cannot engage with the space. But the manner in which an
ethnographer, I, interact characteristically determines the
representation of the space in the larger domain. Most of the texts
about the slums, academic and otherwise, reflect an edgy nervousness
while discussing their subject matter. This uneasiness, first and
foremost, comes from the inability to articulate the anxiety of being
present in the slums. Even when the researchers are informed by the most
radical theoretical and political intent and agendas of the right to the
city for the *jhuggi-walahs,* the act of being *present* and to *engage*
uninhibitedly in their everyday is an anxious ridden prospect as it
challenges (and perhaps also threatens) to reveal their own class,
caste, communal informed practices and politics.

Whilst I was negotiating with my own anxieties, I reached out to
academic texts to find resonance with other researcher’s negotiating
with similar dilemmas. I was seeking out in these texts an assurance
that indeed *it was OK to feel unsettled in these living conditions;
that I really did not like certain people – both men and women in
the slums – for their politics, or their particular personalities and
that I was finding myself drawn to a few people, especially women, with
whom I was not only breaking the researcher-researched biases but
forming emotional relationships.* In the academic texts I had sought
refuge in, I was however left wanting for any confidantes articulating
similar anxieties.

All the dilemmas and issues which the city faces, ‘crime, dirt, filth,
immorality’ in its spread-out territoriality and temporality are
consolidated in the confines of the slums. In that sense, the slums are
magnified and amplified versions of what that city could be if it was
not as controlled and constricted. It is important to consider that the
problems concerning the slums are not a classic situation of the slums,
per se, but prevalent in the city as well.

Within the schematic of this research, which requires establishing an
engaged relationship with the slums, I attempted to deal with the
prejudices at the conceptual, practical and personal level. In this
intent, I realized that my middle-class-background constantly informed
the lens through which I made entries into the space. However, I also
realized that differences necessarily are not a negative entry point to
build relationships, research and otherwise. Until the time the
differences are respected and acknowledged, one cannot aspire for a
relationship and interactions on the same plane. In particularly
recognizing ethnography as much a political intervention as a
methodological tool, the task of constantly negotiating difference, not
towards resolutions but sustained dialogue continues to inform my
research practices and my engagements with the residents of the slums in
Govindpuri.
